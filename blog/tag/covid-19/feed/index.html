<p>The first wave of COVID-19 was extremely tough for the world, including India. People across the country were battling with the many repercussions of the pandemic – be it the effects of the lockdown, loss of jobs, lack of integral resources etc.</p>



<p>The situation seemed to get a tad better but it only worsened as the second wave hit India. The grave situation has brought about a lot of struggle, especially for the COVID-affected patients and their families. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a> are one of the worst-hit communities in India during these troubled times. Millions of children live on the streets where they fend for themselves and works towards finding basic meals, a safe shelter, medical resources, regular education etc. In these difficult times, such resources are even harder to access.</p>



<p>Besides these utilities, underprivileged children and their
families are not finding healthcare facilities or other everyday essentials
that are much-needed during these tough months.</p>



<p>Below are some of the requirements that can help improve the
situation a bit for underprivileged communities:</p>



<p>Awareness sessions are much required as sensitisation can help
bust the many myths surrounding COVID-19, its effects, and the aftermath. Such
sessions will also help the community members understand how to protect
themselves and take necessary safety precautions. The drives will help guide
people who are unaware of the essential steps to take once someone in their family
is infected – they must know how to manage the illness at home and ensure it is
not spread further.</p>



<p>Providing ration and medical kits to families is a must! From
medicines to an oxygen supply, from hospital beds to mid-day meals, children
are in urgent need of such resources that must be accessible to them.</p>



<p>There are innumerable street and working children who are
ignored, abused, and severely affected by the second wave of the pandemic.
Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most trusted non-profit organisations in India,
is working every day to help ensure that children are protected and lead a life
of dignity and care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate
for children’s medical aid</a>
and other support right away!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Help-Children-Utilize-Time-At-Home-During-COVID-19.jpg" alt="Utilize Time At Home During COVID-19" class="wp-image-132"/></figure>



<p>The world is currently facing a tough time due to the outbreak of COVID-19, also known as ‘coronavirus’. There is a lockdown in most countries and people are required to stay indoors and keep all physical contacts to a bare minimum. The pandemic has compelled the governments of most countries to urge people to follow these rules for their well-being and take preventive measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Several people have been digitally sharing their experiences regarding staying indoors, including India where the government recently implemented a 21-day lockdown across the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children, in particular, have been quite affected by the
disruption in their everyday schedule and the changing environment. Especially
at that age, most children are quite aware that there is an undercurrent of
discomfort among the adults and a change in their overall lifestyle. The
schools are also closed and children are not allowed to go out to play or
engage with their friends and classmates. This has surely left them with a lot
of free time at home and making a lot of children feel restless and anxious.
The parents must address these issues head-on instead of tip-toeing around the
situation. Children must be updated about why there is a sudden regulation in
the house, obviously according to the age and understanding of the respective
child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important thing to remember for parents is to make the most
of this time and carry out productive activities in the house to keep a check
on the adrenaline levels of the children. Read on to know about some ways to
bring down the stress levels at home and help children during these unforeseen
times.</p>



<p>Plan a Schedule<br>Children naturally feel more at ease when there is a schedule in place as it keeps them busy and tackles with any boredom that might creep in during a lockdown. A daily routine for learning, playtime, DIY activities, reading hour and quizzes etc shall make for a wholesome day.</p>



<p>Emotionally Strong<br>Children are quite receptive to their surroundings. That is why it is important to balance their emotional levels by spreading more positive and healthy energies in the house. Spending quality family time and reconnecting with relatives online, and ensuring the grandparents are connected with the child, be it at home or digitally, is a great way to keep up their spirits.  </p>



<p>There are several underprivileged children on the streets who are getting affected the most as they continue to be deprived of basic resources like food, clothing and shelter. Salaam Baalak Trust, a non profit organization in New Delhi works towards providing a safe shelter, healthy meals, and quality education. Especially during the pandemic, SBT is helping families receive medical care via its community program team and Childline team. Sanitisation kits and food is also being distributed among several disadvantaged communities across Delhi. SBT continues its work of rescuing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> and providing tools for their rehabilitation. You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to the education of children</a>&nbsp;and help children lead better lives. </p>
