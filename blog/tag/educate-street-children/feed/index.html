<p>Street children face an overwhelming struggle where they have to navigate a world filled with dangers and uncertainties. For these vulnerable children, who are constantly at risk, a safe shelter isn&#8217;t just a physical space; it represents a sanctuary where their basic needs are met and where they find refuge from the harsh realities of life on the streets. Providing secure shelters equipped with integral resources and aid is imperative to protecting and nurturing these children.</p>



<p>These shelters must offer more
than just a roof overhead. They should serve as holistic havens, providing
access to education, healthcare, psychological support, and life skills
training. Education stands as a beacon of hope, empowering these children with
the knowledge and skills necessary for a better future. Integrating healthcare
facilities ensures their physical well-being, addressing ailments resulting
from their impoverished living conditions and often risky lifestyles.</p>



<p>Moreover, psychological support
is crucial, as many <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street
children in India</a> have experienced trauma or abuse and need guidance to
heal and thrive. Equipping them with life skills like vocational training or
basic financial literacy fosters their independence, allowing them to break
free from the cycle of poverty.</p>



<p>Integral to these shelters is a
nurturing environment where caretakers offer mentorship, guidance, and
emotional support. Creating a sense of community and belonging helps rebuild
the shattered trust and confidence of these children, giving them a sense of
purpose and self-worth.</p>



<p>Collaboration between
governments, NGOs, and communities is paramount in establishing and maintaining
such shelters. Adequate funding, resources, and trained staff are essential for
their sustainability. Raising awareness about the plight of street children and
garnering support from society can drive initiatives aimed at providing safe
shelters.</p>



<p>By offering these children a safe
shelter along with essential resources, we not only protect them from the
difficulties of the streets but also invest in shaping a brighter future. It&#8217;s
the collective responsibility of every nation and society to ensure that every
child, regardless of their circumstances, is granted the opportunity to grow up
in a secure and nurturing environment, fostering their potential and
contributing positively to society.

Salaam Baalak Trust is dedicated to protecting
and supporting street children in India, providing safe shelters, education,
and healthcare resources. Your support can transform lives, offering these
vulnerable children a chance at a brighter future. Donate today to Salaam
Baalak Trust and help <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">educate
street children</a>, offering them a secure haven and essential resources they
need to thrive.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Mental Health Support To Street Children" class="wp-image-355" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In recent years, the number of people in India who suffer from depression, anxiety, and other related mental illnesses has increased significantly. In the case of children living on the streets of India, the condition has only worsened, with dangerous surroundings, deteriorating habits, and little or no resources to bank upon. Children who live on the streets have fewer chances for emotional and physical well-being. They are denied the two fundamental emotions for any child—care and love.</p>



<p>Food, shelter, education, basic medical resources etc. are every child’s basic rights, but they still do not have access to these, let alone guidance to improve their mental health. Besides tangible aids, underprivileged children require collective efforts and essential tools, along with healthcare professionals, to work on their mental health. At such an impressionable age, underprivileged children live in such difficult environments. It is time to pay attention to their overall welfare to help them build their personalities and strive for a positive and productive future.</p>



<p>Only a small number of NGOs are genuinely striving to rescue street children and work with them towards rehabilitation in all ways possible. The majority of these cases involve violence, sexual assault, child labour, trafficking etc. This is why it is important to rescue these children and provide them with a secure home complete with all the necessary comforts.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi-NCR</a>, has been working to support street children for over 30 years. The NGO is strategically placed in New Delhi and works around the clock to protect children by rescuing and rehabilitating them and offering them Children’s Homes where they are placed to eventually attend school and receive the finest care that all children deserve.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for children</a>&nbsp;to help them live better lives than the ones on the streets. You can also avail of an&nbsp;income tax exemption&nbsp;under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act to help create a promising future for India’s children. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s mental health programmes now!</p>

<p>In India, several children live on the streets. These children are not raised by anyone, rather they take care of themselves in every way possible. This is why disadvantaged children frequently work odd jobs or partake in illicit activities to support themselves. They struggle to find the minimal necessities, such as food, clothing, meals, and shelter, to survive the difficulties that engulf them. Their surroundings are unpredictable and dark. The underbelly of Delhi, in particular, is no place for young children and yet there are millions of underprivileged children who try every day to somehow survive those overwhelming streets. </p>



<p><a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a>&nbsp;engage in employment throughout those formative years as daily wagers to obtain basic resources. Although it has an impact on their mental, physical, and even emotional health, children persevere and work hard to earn minimum wages to survive on their own on the unforgiving streets.</p>



<p>A major amount of labour force constitutes children. For factory owners, this is the most cost-effective option because children are an illegal workforce and will labour for lesser money and a lot of hard work. Sadly, they are expected to work long hours in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in factories. Children can be found working in varied places, including local restaurants, vendor shops, and companies that produce crackers, clothes, coal, etc. Car cleaners, warehouse employees, porters at train stations and bus stops, messenger boys, and other odd jobs are just a few examples where children can be seen working. Another self-employed activity that frequently involves street children is rag picking. Children gather these arbitrary goods, such as plastic bottles, paper, and tin, which they can sell to make some basic money for food or any other essential resource. Children gather materials to sell for recycling from dustbins and other dumping areas nearby, also known as ragpickers. And yet, no one speaks up for them or protects them.</p>



<p>Street and working children are in desperate need of assistance. A reputable non-profit organisation in India, Salaam Baalak Trust, works with children in need to uplift and empower them through education, healthcare facilities, a safe shelter, performing arts programmes, mental health support etc. Your contribution can significantly improve the lives of children living on the streets.&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a>&nbsp;right away and help Salaam Baalak Trust make a real difference!</p>

<p>Street children are one of the most ignored marginalized communities that need urgent help. They are not given access to their basic rights and more often not, many children grow up without having access to resources like education, regular meals, a safe shelter, proper healthcare facilities etc. Instead, children lead a vulnerable life on the dangerous streets of India. They end up growing up without any supervision or mentoring. Millions of children in India grow up without basic utilities. They fend for themselves in varied ways. Children end up choosing the illegal route where they engage in child labour.</p>



<p>Child labour essentially means children work to earn money. This may include a few hours every day, a one-time gig, or full-time jobs. Children are illegally employed in factories, engaged in domestic labour, restaurants, stalls etc. Even though it is unethical and illegal, children are employed all over India. It is extremely unhealthy and unsafe but underprivileged children start working from such a tender age to survive with the bare minimum wages that they earn.</p>



<p>Ragpicking is another common sight where children can be seen at bus stands and railway stations. Children pick and sort material that is then sold for recycling. This is how children earn – they collect from anything made of plastic (typically water bottles) to paper and tin. This is why so many children can be found with gunny bags and loitering near dustbins and other filthy sections.</p>



<p>Many children also become porters to transfer material from one place to another. This requirement is typically at railway stations, bus stands, wholesale markets, and godowns. This is also an excruciatingly painful, tiring, and overwhelming task where children have to push or pull the weight on a cart for short or long distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust is an&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi</a>&nbsp;that has been working tirelessly to uplift and empower street children. SBT, a reputed and well-established non-profit organization, rescues and rehabilitates children living on the streets through its many programs. SBT ensures children have access to proper education, a safe shelter, healthcare facilities, and regular hot and nutritious meals. Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation</a>&nbsp;can help children in India and ensure they have a promising and positive future ahead. So, connect with SBT and donate now to help make a difference!</p>

<p>Republic Day is commemorated on 26th January. This is an integral occasion for all Indians as it is the day when the nation marched towards democracy and the Declaration of Indian Independence was issued. The country has had many milestones since then and varied developments have been quite fruitful in the global context. The children of India who live on the streets still have a long way to go. Unfortunately, they continue to live a life of deprivation where they long for safety and protection.</p>



<p>India is a strong nation with many possibilities and opportunities extended to its people across the globe. Underprivileged children, however, have a hard time living without basic resources. They are deprived of all basic resources, including shelter, food, education etc. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> have a hard time living in unpredictable and overwhelming environments that affect them in more ways than one – physically as well as psychologically.Many children end up working at varied places to find odd jobs, thus engaging in child labour. Child abuse is another awful practice that several children become a part of – be it due to prostitution, gangs and other harmful practices.</p>



<p>It is time
children receive love and care, as well as access to healthcare resources etc
to be able to have a healthy and productive childhood. Children must be able to
play with other children, experience joy and jubilation, and have a prosperous
future, devoid of negativity and hostility.</p>



<p>This
Republic Day, let’s pledge to be more forthcoming towards the welfare of street
children. They must also be seen, heard and welcomed as an integral part of
society. Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most respected and trusted non-profit
organisations in India, has been working diligently towards the betterment of
street and working children. SBT has set up many Children’s Homes to ensure
children receive resources that help them in learning and growing properly.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for the children</a> of India and protect their future. After all, a country’s growth is directly related to the opportunities and resources its children have. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s programs and extend better and wholesome living conditions for children. Donate now!</p>

<p>Street children found on the streets is a norm in India. Millions of children live on the streets, without any basic resources. This has become a sight that everyone has gotten used to which, unfortunately, does not make one cringe. But this could not be worse for society and India’s development, besides the negative impact it has on the lives of those children. After all, the condition of the youth defines where the country is heading. Children without any guardians or support system to guide them through childhood, puberty and eventually adulthood are horrifying; these impressionable years much be acknowledged and worked upon with the respective child.</p>



<p>In the case of street children, most of them are runaways who
were desperate to escape the situation at home – it could be due to poverty,
abuse, exploitation, lack of love and care etc. The situation on the streets is
no better of course but it is too late for the child to realise as they are
already living on the streets by then. They have no money for basic utilities,
no shelter for protection, and no access to meals or a group of people to
depend on.</p>



<p>The reason why street children are considered as one of the most
vulnerable groups in India (UNICEF) is that they are susceptible to all sorts
of abuse &#8211; child labour, sexual abuse (prostitution, child trafficking etc),
child marriage, illiteracy etc.</p>



<p>The health of underprivileged children also gets quite compromised as they do not have access to regular vaccinations, integral immunizations etc. They are also deprived of quality healthcare, especially mental health programs which are much needed as many street children fall into the traps of hard drugs, depression and other forms of self-harm. Many of them are unable to communicate with other people or exhibit social skills of any sort. Lack of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health programs for street children</a><strong> </strong>can prove to be more harmful, affect their personal growth and decrease their chances of having a safe and supportive community.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to children’s education</a>​ and support Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has empowered thousands of street children. Donate now!</p>

<p>All children deserve a life that includes basic resources, protection, encouragement, and opportunities to grow. Their birth-right includes utilities as well as a wholesome environment that helps them prosper and constantly strive for excellence.</p>



<p>A conducive environment for children also includes one where
they are surrounded by mentors and other encouraging adults who guide them and
support them through all hurdles and milestones. Regular schooling, hot and
nutritious meals that they have access to at least thrice a day, a safe
shelter, and quality healthcare facilities are some of the resources that play
a pivotal role in all children’s lives. These are all necessities that help
them in many ways to lead a happy childhood and strive for a better future.</p>



<p>But in the case of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>, the reality is quite different. There is a dearth of material and emotional support, and what makes matters worse is that they need to fend for themselves in an unforgiving and tough world on the streets.</p>



<p>Deprived of mental health and tools to handle difficult
situations does not help their cause either. From facing everyday challenges
alone to falling into the traps of substance abuse, many factors play a part in
the deteriorating conditions of underprivileged children. Some children also
end up participating in child labour where they work long hours as daily wage
earners for minimum pay. This affects them mentally, physically, and
emotionally, and also depletes their chances of landing a stable and
well-paying job in the future.</p>



<p>One of the most reputed non-profit organisations is Salaam Baalak Trust that has been working to rescue and rehabilitate street and working children. You can donate for <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">children’s medical ai</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">d</a></strong> and help SBT ensure that abandoned children have a better childhood and a promising future.</p>



<p>The NGO runs shelter homes and many child-centric programs to
help provide essential resources for children. SBT also provides love and care,
besides running mental health programs to help with de-addiction and other
trauma that children are afflicted with from their time on the streets. So wait
no more and donate to Salaam Baalak Trust today!</p>

<p>All children deserve an environment with love, care, protection, and basic resources. Utilities like a safe shelter, basic education, healthy meals, and healthcare facilities are a must for children across all backgrounds. Unfortunately, this is not the case with street and working children.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">Education for street children</a>&nbsp;continues to be a distant aspiration. Instead of being an obvious requirement, many children on the streets struggle with everyday battles like protecting themselves, find scraps to eat and making ends meet to have a shelter etc. Surviving on the harsh streets can be overwhelming for a child and what makes matters worse is that they are deprived of mentors or any responsible adults around them who can help guide them.</p>



<p>This is why many children fall under the trap
of illegal activities and end up engaging with the wrong company. Several
trafficked children follow the lead of those that rob, cheat, or encourage the
children to protect themselves by harming others. Such actions affect children
for the long run where they become even more clueless about their actions and
the repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many children also face mental health issues
due to drug abuse, physical or sexual abuse, violence, abandonment, and trauma
of many types. From sleepless nights to anger issues, from addiction to lack of
social skills, underprivileged children face many tough situations that their
impressionable mind and gentle spirit is unable to process. This is why street
children need all the more positive reinforcement and constant support system
to help them recover and revive from the experiences of the underbelly of the
streets.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most reputed
non-profit organisations, works hard to give a promising future to children in
India. SBT runs multiple shelter homes for boys and girls and provides
clothing, food, and proper education for the children. SBT also runs mental
health programs and ensures that children receive quality medical resources.</p>



<p>You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to children’s medical aid</a>​ and ensure they finally have people rooting for their well-being. After all, all children deserve to lead a happy childhood and have a fair chance at a promising future. Donate to Salaam Baalak Trust now!</p>

<p>20th November is celebrated as World Children’s Day. This day reminds us to protect and encourage children to strive for a prosperous future. It also urges people to help create environments for children where they can grow, feel safe, and nurture their dreams.</p>



<p>There is also a side of reality that is rather grim as a large number of children who live on the streets of India. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a> are a major part of the society that survives on less than basic resources, be it food, shelter, clothing, medical facilities etc. Street children can be found on the streets and in many vacant alleys. They can also be seen at railway stations, bus stands, or traffic signals. Many street children are beggars while others either loiter around, engage in illegal activities, and/or participate in child labour.</p>



<p>Many
children work in factories, local stalls or shops, and are even employed as
domestic help. Underprivileged children strive to get by (survive) daily and
their main concern is to earn money however they possibly can. Such is the
exhausting and vulnerable life of a street and working child in India. But this
is far from what a child deserves, especially during their formative years. This
impressionable age bracket demands that a child lives in a surrounding that
contributes to their growth, and not worry about how and when their next meal
will come.</p>



<p>To help thousands of vulnerable children, Salaam Baalak Trust, a well-known nonprofit organization in India, has been working relentlessly for decades to improve their condition. Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi rescues and rehabilitates children. SBT also runs shelter homes for girls and boys where they are provided with a safe shelter, regular and nutritious meals, clothing, and timely health check-ups. Most importantly, the NGO ensures that all children receive regular education to ensure they have a brighter future. There are also many extra-curricular activities that the children can participate in which helps in an overall improvement in the attitude, personality, and lifestyle of the children.<br>This World Children’s Day, support SBT’s programs by <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>.

<p>15th October is marked as World Food Day across the globe. This day is celebrated to spread awareness about the importance of food and also the harmful effects of unhealthy and irregular meals. Also, one of the main objectives of World Food Day is to throw light on the reality of less or no food available to many underserved communities in the world. Underprivileged children in Indiaare one of the worst-hit groups that face acute repercussions on their mental, physical, and emotional well-being due to starvation.</p>



<p>Healthy diets must be accessible to street children but this
necessity and basic right continue to be a privilege for millions of at-risk
children in India. Where food should be easily available and affordable, many
children who live on the streets engage in the following activities to somehow
make ends meet, to be able to have at least a meal a day.</p>



<ol><li>Many street children engage
in odd jobs like working at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>,
shops, selling everyday utilities etc. Child labour among street children is
extremely common because most children do not have the money to fend for
themselves, thus they become daily wagers to fill their bellies.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</li><li>The yearning for food compel
many street children to engage in illegal activities like pickpocketing,
joining street gangs, or even prostitution. The needs of street children are
neglected therefore, their source of income is derived from any means possible
which affects their current as well as long-term health.</li></ol>



<p>The impressionable years of a child&#8217;s life require for them to have regular and nutritious meals. The food must be well-cooked and prepared in a hygienic environment. Food, clothes, shelter is a right that must be extended to every child, irrespective of their economic background. Salaam Baalak Trust, a nonprofit organization based in Delhi, has been working tirelessly to ensure that street children feel safe, protected, and well looked-after. You can support the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter homes for children</a> by Salaam Baalak Trust to ensure more street childrenhave access to a safe environment and healthy meals.  This World Food Day, <strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">d</a></strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">onate</a> generously to Salaam Baalak Trust and ensure that street children under their careget three hot, cooked meals daily. </p>
