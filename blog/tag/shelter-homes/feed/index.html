<p>In the bustling streets of India, where life&#8217;s challenges are evident, a safe shelter emerges as a beacon of hope for the most vulnerable among us &#8211; street and working children. These shelters serve as sanctuaries, providing a haven from the harsh realities they face daily.</p>



<p>A safe shelter offers these
children more than just a roof over their heads; it provides a nurturing
environment where their physical, emotional, and psychological well-being is
prioritised. Here, they find solace in the dangers of the streets, shielding
them from exploitation, abuse, and the perils of a life without protection.</p>



<p>Within these sanctuaries,
marginalised children are granted access to education, healthcare, and
nutrition &#8211; basic rights that are often out of reach for those living on the
streets. This protective cocoon empowers them with the tools they need to break
free from the cycle of poverty and build a brighter future.</p>



<p>Moreover, safe shelters foster a
sense of belonging and community among these children. Surrounded by other
children of their age group who share similar experiences, they form bonds that
provide emotional support and companionship. This supportive network instills a
sense of hope, confidence, and self-worth, crucial elements for their personal
growth and development.</p>



<p>As these children flourish within
the protective embrace of a safe shelter, their potential begins to unfold.
With access to education and skills training, they gain the means to chase
their dreams and unlock their full potential. They become equipped to navigate
the challenges that once seemed insurmountable, propelling them towards a
future brimming with promise.</p>



<p>In essence, a safe shelter is
more than just a physical structure; it is a sanctuary that breathes life into
the aspirations and dreams of marginalised and at-risk children. It offers them
a chance to thrive, to rise above adversity, and to become the architects of
their own destiny. It is a testament to the transformative power of compassion,
protection, and opportunity.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an esteemed <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi NCR</a>, provides a safe
haven for vulnerable children. Their shelters, including a <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">girls&#8217;
residential home in Gurugram</a>, offer protection, education, and a nurturing
community. Support their vital work by donating today. Together, we can empower
these children to break free from adversity and build a brighter tomorrow.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Morning-Prayer-1024x768.jpg" alt="SBT shelters" class="wp-image-399" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Morning-Prayer-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Morning-Prayer-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Morning-Prayer-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Morning-Prayer.jpg 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the bustling streets of India, where life unfolds in its myriad forms, one often encounters a harsh reality – the plight of street children. These young souls, abandoned or forced into destitution, navigate through the harsh urban landscapes, devoid of the basic necessities and safety nets that most of us take for granted. It is imperative to understand the critical need for safeguarding these vulnerable lives and providing them with a sanctuary of hope.</p>



<p>The streets, while
dynamic and vibrant, can also be unforgiving. For these children, it becomes an
overly difficult journey filled with danger, exploitation, and despair. Lack of
proper nutrition, exposure to violence, and susceptibility to substance abuse
are grim realities that confront them daily. Without intervention, their
potential remains untapped, lost in the struggle for mere survival.</p>



<p>This is where
organisations like Salaam Baalak Trust step in, recognising the urgency of rescuing
these children from the clutches of adversity. By offering safe shelters, they
provide more than just a roof over their heads. These shelters become
sanctuaries of stability where children are nurtured, educated, and given a
chance to dream.</p>



<p>Within the protective
walls of these shelters, children find a haven of emotional and physical
security. Proper nutrition, clean clothing, and access to healthcare are
prioritised, ensuring their overall well-being. Additionally, structured
educational programmes empower them with knowledge, igniting their potential to
break free from the cycle of poverty and destitution.</p>



<p>Moreover, these
shelters offer a supportive community where children can heal from the wounds
of their past. They are provided with counselling and guidance, allowing them
to process their experiences and rebuild their sense of self-worth. This
nurturing environment fosters a sense of belonging and opens avenues for them
to reintegrate into society as confident, capable individuals.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi NCR</a>, provides safe shelters for India&#8217;s street children, offering them vital refuge from the dangers of the streets. These SBT shelters, including a <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">girls residential home in Gurugram</a>, nurture, educate, and empower vulnerable youth, giving them hope for a brighter future. Your contribution can make a world of difference. Support our mission today. Donate now!</p>

<p>In the heart of bustling cities, there exists an expansive group that is often overlooked and forgotten: street children. These young souls, braving the harsh realities of life on the streets, face an uphill battle against not only poverty and neglect but also a lack of access to proper healthcare. The need to protect underprivileged children and provide them with comprehensive healthcare support is paramount, as it directly impacts their chances of having a healthy, happy childhood and a promising future.</p>



<p>Imagine a childhood spent without the warmth of a secure home, without proper nourishment, and without the protection of basic medical care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> are exposed to numerous health risks, from malnutrition and respiratory infections to injuries sustained on the unforgiving streets. The absence of timely medical attention exacerbates their vulnerability, jeopardising their overall well-being. By extending proper healthcare to these children, we ensure not only their physical health but also their mental and emotional resilience.</p>



<p>A healthy childhood
is the foundation upon which a promising future is built. Adequate healthcare
plays an indispensable role in nurturing the potential of at-risk children,
enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and adversity. When these children
receive regular medical check-ups, vaccinations, and treatments, they are
better equipped to focus on their education and personal growth. By addressing
their health needs, we pave the way for a brighter tomorrow where these
children can contribute positively to society.</p>



<p>Moreover, providing
healthcare support to underserved children sends a powerful message—that they
matter. When we invest in their well-being, we communicate their worth and
dignity as individuals. This fosters a sense of belonging and instills in them
the confidence to dream big. A healthy childhood brings with it a sense of
normalcy, offering these children a chance to experience the joys and wonders that
every child deserves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a beacon of hope, is dedicated to uplifting street and working children. With unwavering commitment, they provide essential medical aid, nurturing these young lives towards brighter futures. By offering healthcare and resources, SBT ensures that vulnerable children receive the care they deserve. Your support can change lives, offering these children a chance for better health and opportunities. Let&#8217;s come together to create lasting change. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for Street children</a> and become a part of SBT&#8217;s inspiring journey.</p>

<p>Street children are those who are forced to live on the streets due to poverty, neglect, or abuse. These children are exposed to a wide range of dangers, such as violence, sexual abuse, and substance abuse. To ensure their safety and well-being, it is essential to provide them with a safe shelter.</p>



<p>The plight of street
children is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. These children are
often forced to work in hazardous conditions, beg for food and money, and face
the threat of violence and abuse daily. Child labour is still a rampant
practice that must be addressed and resolved.</p>



<p>Without a safe
shelter, these children are exposed to a variety of dangers, including
exploitation, trafficking, and violence. In addition to physical dangers, these
children are also at risk of developing mental health issues such as depression
and anxiety, which can have long-term effects on their overall development.</p>



<p>Providing street
children with a safe shelter is crucial to protecting and supporting them. Safe
shelters can provide a temporary home for these children and offer them
protection from the dangers of the streets. They can also provide them with
access to necessities such as food, clothing, and healthcare, as well as
education and vocational training.</p>



<p>Safe shelters can
also provide a sense of stability and support for these children, allowing them
to develop healthy relationships and social skills. This can help them to
transition back into society and lead successful, productive lives.</p>



<p>In the case of young
girls, many of them hail from villages and hamlets and wind up on the streets
of big cities. Many of these girls have either fled their homes or got
separated from them. They are often victims of trafficking, kidnapping, or
domestic violence. For girls surviving on the streets alone, each day is filled
with numerous difficulties and dangers. They frequently face instances of
sexual assault, physical abuse, and efforts to coerce them into prostitution. These
girls yearn to be under a roof where they can rest soundly at night.</p>



<p>This is why
governments, NGOs, and individuals must work together to ensure that street
children are protected, supported, and given the resources, they need to
succeed. This includes providing safe shelters, educational facilities,
healthcare, and job training, as well as addressing the underlying issues that
force children onto the streets.</p>



<p>Salaam Balaak Trust,
a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charitable trust in Delhi</a>, offers a sensitive and nurturing setting for street and
working children and other vulnerable children. It aims to offer children a
place where they can realise their full potential and have access to a safe
shelter, an education, and good health and nutrition. So, wait no more and make
an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online donation in India</a>&nbsp;to support India&#8217;s children and give them a
promising future.</p>

<p>National Education Day is an occasion that commemorates the need for all children to be educated. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">education for street children</a> is still not a reality in most parts of India. The number of children living on the streets and working hard to survive has been steadily rising. Education is not even on their radar amidst the struggle to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Innumerable underprivileged children wind up on the streets for a variety of reasons. Many of them travel to Delhi from their impoverished backgrounds in search of chances and a better life. Some run away from their homes due to abusive and careless guardians, while others have been reported to be cut off from their relatives and are unable to contact them again. The suffering of these children as they struggle on the unpredictable streets of India is a wake-up call for the entire nation.</p>



<p>Presently, children can be seen doing varied random activities on the streets, be it selling knick-knacks at traffic signals, begging, picking up trash, or worse, engaging in illegal activities. This is not the life fit for anyone &#8211; definitely not for children.</p>



<p>A Tough Life<br>The problems that Delhi&#8217;s street children face are numerous. Children not only endure a rough life that is frequently dangerous and without shelter, but they also have to deal with violence and brutality. Adults abuse young children, compel them to work, beg, and commit crimes. They are also verbally, physically, and emotionally abused. There have been reports of abuse and violence against more than half of the population of street children, and so much of it still goes unreported. The majority of children lack ID cards or other documents that would allow them to participate in government programmes that supply essentials to minors. The world&#8217;s greatest concentration of street children is thought to be in India.</p>



<p>Protection and Rehabilitation<br>Numerous NGOs have been extending support in many forms to support street children.

<p><br>India has a large population of street children. Using India&#8217;s massive rail system, children run away from their homes to escape abuse, violence, and poverty. They travel to big cities in the hopes of leaving that overwhelmingly difficult life behind, only to find themselves in the underbelly of the streets, alone and deprived. When thousands of children arrive at India&#8217;s enormous and crowded train stations, they are disoriented, afraid, and alone, with no idea what to do. They are forced to live on the platforms after having their ambitions ruthlessly crushed. This is happening with innumerable children on a daily basis.</p>



<p>For several troublesome reasons, children flee their homes or are compelled to do so. Many people desire a better future and the chance to work in urban areas. But without any resources at all, they are neither able to survive on the streets nor reunite with their families.</p>



<p>Abusers looking to take advantage of vulnerable and lonely children roam around in the hopes of finding these children to make them their prey for vested interests. They either exploit them by engaging the children in child labour or other forms of child trafficking, or other illegal activities like robbery, prostitution etc. This also compels many children to turn to substance misuse to handle their mental health and many other difficulties but addiction only makes matters worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s well-known&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a>, has been working hard to help rescue and rehabilitate underprivileged children. SBT has been running multiple shelter homes to ensure children have access to food, shelter, safety, and assistance. SBT has been working hard for their welfare for over 30 years. It is time to protect more children and prevent them from being ignored or abused, and that is why SBT runs varied child-centric programmes besides its education programmes for children. The activities include mental health support, performing arts workshops, sports practices etc. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a>&nbsp;to help make a difference and gift a better and more promising future to these forgotten children.</p>

<p>Street children are a reality and their existence must be acknowledged as a first step. There are millions of children living on the streets of India, without any adult supervision or support from society. These children are deprived of any of the basic rights – they do not have access to proper education, daily meals, healthcare facilities, or a safe shelter. The children are either runaways, orphans, have cut ties with their family, or are unable to locate them and have no other option but to live on the streets.</p>



<p>All of these children live on their own – they work odd jobs to gather some basic earnings to live off on the streets. Be it in factories or at restaurants, children are employed for odd jobs where their wages are bare minimum and their rights are compromised. Child labour is a major issue in India as children work in unhealthy and unsafe environments. At the age when they should be studying in schools and playing with other children of their age, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> put their lives in danger on a daily basis to earn money. Their mental, physical, and psychological well-being is attacked and deteriorates due to such circumstances.</p>



<p>Children’s mental health also gets affected as children need to be in a healthy environment. They deserve a safe and protected atmosphere to grow properly and healthily. Regular medical tests are also important that must include timely vaccinations. Immunizations can help protect children from avoidable diseases as avoiding these can even affect them for life, or worse, cause death.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children deserve to be around positive, encouraging, and supportive adults. They must be given playtime and tools to grow up to be independent and wholesome individuals. Many non-profit organizations are working to improve the lives of children. Salaam Baalak Trust is a renowned NGO that has been working for over 30 years to rescue and rehabilitate children. SBT is ensuring that children receive food, security, health, education and love – essentials required for children to grow up well. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a> and help make a real difference in their lives.

<p>International Volunteer Day is commemorated on 5th December. Volunteering is an exhilarating experience that can truly evolve the volunteer and help make a difference. Choosing the organization to volunteer with can be quite a turning point for anyone, therefore it&#8217;s essential to filter the reasons where one wants to volunteer and why. This phase leaves an indelible mark that truly helps in honing a volunteer into a strong and confident person. Read on to know how non-profits can support a volunteer:<br>  <br> New Experiences<br> Working with an NGO helps volunteers become more accountable for their actions. It also contributes to churning out productive work while becoming purpose-driven. While volunteering with an NGO, individuals get to work for a worthy cause like supporting <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com">street children</a> and bringing a positive change in the lives of several beneficiaries.<br>  <br> Better Skill Sets<br> Volunteering with an NGO offers an opportunity to work on multiple programs. It could be either virtual or ground-work. Many volunteers choose to dive into fundraising while others prefer imparting specific skills directly to the beneficiaries, like Arts and Crafts, teaching, performance arts etc. Many volunteers also choose to extend their professional skills to the non-profit without charging them – becoming a social media manager, providing legal aid, doing event planning etc. In this process, the volunteers get a chance to extend information as well as gain more experience. They also learn multiple things in a short span.<br>  <br> Sense of Achievement<br> Volunteering at an NGO adds a lot of value to one’s life. It helps them on a personal level as well as on a professional level. The time, efforts, skills, and energy that a volunteer puts in are truly commendable and worthwhile for the NGO as well as the volunteer. <br>  <br> Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed and trusted organizations that welcome volunteers to support their ongoing programs for street and working children.

<p>Diwali is here &#8211; the wonderful festival of lights that brings prosperity and joy into our lives. But this is not the case for street children. Millions of children go to work every day to earn daily wages. This is their reality of street children and the reason behind their deteriorating health &#8211; mental, physical and emotional. Countless children from all walks of life in India spend their childhood working hard to earn any basic wages to have access to some resources to survive. Instead of enjoying the joys of these early growth periods, they work long hours and are involved in tedious chores. Child labour has become the norm for most people where they don&#8217;t bat an eye when children beg on the streets or work at a roadside stall or as domestic help etc. Children can even be seen washing dishes behind the restaurant, sitting at paan shops, or shining shoes on many busy streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason for their participation in multiple areas of work is because they have no other option to survive. Most underprivileged children are orphans and live in abject poverty. Many are also abandoned while others work to help contribute to their family’s minimum income. Many children run away from home; these street children do not have any guardians or other resources to guide them on the right path to a healthy childhood.</p>



<p>There are many dangerous places such as different types of factories etc where children can be found working in extreme heat or bitter cold. They participate in dangerous activities to earn less than the minimum wage, even at the expense of their health. Children can be seen working at factories that produce clothing, crackers, tobacco, biscuits, etc, and many other unstructured businesses that employ young children to work for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Child labour keeps children away from playing with other children which is extremely harmful to a child during their impressionable years. This greatly affects their psychological and social development. Through proper playtime activities, children learn to cultivate friendship and nurture positive connections with others which helps them become confident, compassionate and caring people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the true essence of Diwali, an auspicious occasion, you can donate to Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has been working for the welfare of street children for over 30 years. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">Donate for children&#8217;s medical aid</a> and help SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescue abandoned children</a>.

<p>All children deserve an environment with love, care, protection, and basic resources. Utilities like a safe shelter, basic education, healthy meals, and healthcare facilities are a must for children across all backgrounds. Unfortunately, this is not the case with street and working children.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">Education for street children</a>&nbsp;continues to be a distant aspiration. Instead of being an obvious requirement, many children on the streets struggle with everyday battles like protecting themselves, find scraps to eat and making ends meet to have a shelter etc. Surviving on the harsh streets can be overwhelming for a child and what makes matters worse is that they are deprived of mentors or any responsible adults around them who can help guide them.</p>



<p>This is why many children fall under the trap
of illegal activities and end up engaging with the wrong company. Several
trafficked children follow the lead of those that rob, cheat, or encourage the
children to protect themselves by harming others. Such actions affect children
for the long run where they become even more clueless about their actions and
the repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many children also face mental health issues
due to drug abuse, physical or sexual abuse, violence, abandonment, and trauma
of many types. From sleepless nights to anger issues, from addiction to lack of
social skills, underprivileged children face many tough situations that their
impressionable mind and gentle spirit is unable to process. This is why street
children need all the more positive reinforcement and constant support system
to help them recover and revive from the experiences of the underbelly of the
streets.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most reputed
non-profit organisations, works hard to give a promising future to children in
India. SBT runs multiple shelter homes for boys and girls and provides
clothing, food, and proper education for the children. SBT also runs mental
health programs and ensures that children receive quality medical resources.</p>



<p>You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to children’s medical aid</a>​ and ensure they finally have people rooting for their well-being. After all, all children deserve to lead a happy childhood and have a fair chance at a promising future. Donate to Salaam Baalak Trust now!</p>
