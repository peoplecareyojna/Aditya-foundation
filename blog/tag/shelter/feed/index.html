<p>Street children face an overwhelming struggle where they have to navigate a world filled with dangers and uncertainties. For these vulnerable children, who are constantly at risk, a safe shelter isn&#8217;t just a physical space; it represents a sanctuary where their basic needs are met and where they find refuge from the harsh realities of life on the streets. Providing secure shelters equipped with integral resources and aid is imperative to protecting and nurturing these children.</p>



<p>These shelters must offer more
than just a roof overhead. They should serve as holistic havens, providing
access to education, healthcare, psychological support, and life skills
training. Education stands as a beacon of hope, empowering these children with
the knowledge and skills necessary for a better future. Integrating healthcare
facilities ensures their physical well-being, addressing ailments resulting
from their impoverished living conditions and often risky lifestyles.</p>



<p>Moreover, psychological support
is crucial, as many <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street
children in India</a> have experienced trauma or abuse and need guidance to
heal and thrive. Equipping them with life skills like vocational training or
basic financial literacy fosters their independence, allowing them to break
free from the cycle of poverty.</p>



<p>Integral to these shelters is a
nurturing environment where caretakers offer mentorship, guidance, and
emotional support. Creating a sense of community and belonging helps rebuild
the shattered trust and confidence of these children, giving them a sense of
purpose and self-worth.</p>



<p>Collaboration between
governments, NGOs, and communities is paramount in establishing and maintaining
such shelters. Adequate funding, resources, and trained staff are essential for
their sustainability. Raising awareness about the plight of street children and
garnering support from society can drive initiatives aimed at providing safe
shelters.</p>



<p>By offering these children a safe
shelter along with essential resources, we not only protect them from the
difficulties of the streets but also invest in shaping a brighter future. It&#8217;s
the collective responsibility of every nation and society to ensure that every
child, regardless of their circumstances, is granted the opportunity to grow up
in a secure and nurturing environment, fostering their potential and
contributing positively to society.

Salaam Baalak Trust is dedicated to protecting
and supporting street children in India, providing safe shelters, education,
and healthcare resources. Your support can transform lives, offering these
vulnerable children a chance at a brighter future. Donate today to Salaam
Baalak Trust and help <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">educate
street children</a>, offering them a secure haven and essential resources they
need to thrive.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-08-at-5.04.43-PM-2.jpeg" alt="Safe Shelters in Delhi NCR" class="wp-image-412" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-08-at-5.04.43-PM-2.jpeg 905w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-08-at-5.04.43-PM-2-300x214.jpeg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-08-at-5.04.43-PM-2-768x549.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px" /></figure>



<p>In the bustling streets of India, where life&#8217;s challenges are evident, a safe shelter emerges as a beacon of hope for the most vulnerable among us &#8211; street and working children. These shelters serve as sanctuaries, providing a haven from the harsh realities they face daily.</p>



<p>A safe shelter offers these
children more than just a roof over their heads; it provides a nurturing
environment where their physical, emotional, and psychological well-being is
prioritised. Here, they find solace in the dangers of the streets, shielding
them from exploitation, abuse, and the perils of a life without protection.</p>



<p>Within these sanctuaries,
marginalised children are granted access to education, healthcare, and
nutrition &#8211; basic rights that are often out of reach for those living on the
streets. This protective cocoon empowers them with the tools they need to break
free from the cycle of poverty and build a brighter future.</p>



<p>Moreover, safe shelters foster a
sense of belonging and community among these children. Surrounded by other
children of their age group who share similar experiences, they form bonds that
provide emotional support and companionship. This supportive network instills a
sense of hope, confidence, and self-worth, crucial elements for their personal
growth and development.</p>



<p>As these children flourish within
the protective embrace of a safe shelter, their potential begins to unfold.
With access to education and skills training, they gain the means to chase
their dreams and unlock their full potential. They become equipped to navigate
the challenges that once seemed insurmountable, propelling them towards a
future brimming with promise.</p>



<p>In essence, a safe shelter is
more than just a physical structure; it is a sanctuary that breathes life into
the aspirations and dreams of marginalised and at-risk children. It offers them
a chance to thrive, to rise above adversity, and to become the architects of
their own destiny. It is a testament to the transformative power of compassion,
protection, and opportunity.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an esteemed <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi NCR</a>, provides a safe
haven for vulnerable children. Their shelters, including a <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">girls&#8217;
residential home in Gurugram</a>, offer protection, education, and a nurturing
community. Support their vital work by donating today. Together, we can empower
these children to break free from adversity and build a brighter tomorrow.</p>

<p>National Education Day is an occasion that commemorates the need for all children to be educated. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">education for street children</a> is still not a reality in most parts of India. The number of children living on the streets and working hard to survive has been steadily rising. Education is not even on their radar amidst the struggle to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Innumerable underprivileged children wind up on the streets for a variety of reasons. Many of them travel to Delhi from their impoverished backgrounds in search of chances and a better life. Some run away from their homes due to abusive and careless guardians, while others have been reported to be cut off from their relatives and are unable to contact them again. The suffering of these children as they struggle on the unpredictable streets of India is a wake-up call for the entire nation.</p>



<p>Presently, children can be seen doing varied random activities on the streets, be it selling knick-knacks at traffic signals, begging, picking up trash, or worse, engaging in illegal activities. This is not the life fit for anyone &#8211; definitely not for children.</p>



<p>A Tough Life<br>The problems that Delhi&#8217;s street children face are numerous. Children not only endure a rough life that is frequently dangerous and without shelter, but they also have to deal with violence and brutality. Adults abuse young children, compel them to work, beg, and commit crimes. They are also verbally, physically, and emotionally abused. There have been reports of abuse and violence against more than half of the population of street children, and so much of it still goes unreported. The majority of children lack ID cards or other documents that would allow them to participate in government programmes that supply essentials to minors. The world&#8217;s greatest concentration of street children is thought to be in India.</p>



<p>Protection and Rehabilitation<br>Numerous NGOs have been extending support in many forms to support street children. One such NGO that has dedicated years of effort to the well-being of India&#8217;s street children is Salaam Baalak Trust. SBT offers food, clothing, healthcare, education, and most importantly, love and care. This National Education Day, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for children&#8217;s education</a> to help give them a promising future, one that enables them to pursue their dreams and eventually have a job to pay their bills. Let’s give a better life to them!</p>

<p>India is a wonderful country with many developments and milestones that have been acknowledged on the world stage. People in India are generous too, helping those in need. Donations are integral for the non-profit organisations that have been working to protect underprivileged communities. Many people, especially <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children in India</a>, are still living without any of the basic resources. Children on the streets struggle to find food, shelter, education, safety, or protection. They constantly live in a vulnerable environment, deprived of support or improvement in any area of their lives.</p>



<p>Donating for the welfare of children can bring
quite a change in their lives. Children can get the opportunity to live without
fear or insecurities. They can also have a productive and positive childhood
that most street children never get to experience. Many working children engage
in child labour where they work odd jobs to earn a basic wage to survive
somehow. Many children fall into the trap of drug abuse, prostitution, violence
etc that does a lot of harm to them – mentally, physically, and psychologically
too.</p>



<p>Generous contributions to an NGO can help run child-centric programs to rescue and rehabilitate children and give them a life where they grow up to be in white-collar jobs – without the fear of poverty or illiteracy. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working towards the welfare of children for over 30 years. The NGO is known for its varied programs that help build better lives for street children. Donors can support Salaam Baalak Trust and even save tax on their donations. A monthly or one-time donation can help underprivileged children in more ways than one. SBT runs varied boys and girls residential homes across Delhi/NCR. A birthday donation or any other special occasion donation can also help in providing necessities to children under SBT’s care. It is time to help make a difference and ensure children have a real chance at a promising future. Avail a 50% income tax exemption under 80G of the Income Tax Act and ensure a safe and healthy life for street and working children. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for children’s education</a> and support Salaam Baalak Trust now! </p>

<p>Street children can be found all over India &#8211; at bus stops, railways stations, dark alleys, poverty-stricken colonies, highways etc. Their existence is often ignored by the privileged ones but that needs to stop. After all, a country’s progress is defined by how the youth is progressing, and the reality of street children is deplorable. Millions of children live without adult supervision or any sort of essential resources. They do not have access to monetary or mental support to help navigate life and grow in a healthy environment.</p>



<p>15th August is here! A special day for Indians across the globe as Independence Day is celebrated with much pride and pomp. This day cannot be commemorated without acknowledging the issue and vowing to be more rigorous in protecting underprivileged children. Their plight needs to heard and resolved in more ways than one. From everyday violence to life-threatening scenarios, from zero accountability to illegal activities, from acute poverty to lack of any scope of a healthy and happy future, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>, like all other children, deserve a better life.</p>



<p>Some basic resources help lead a quality life for everyone,
including underprivileged children who do not have these aids. These include
quality education, regular and nutritious meals, proper healthcare facilities,
and a safe shelter. Children also require love, care, protection, and mental
health support to grow in nurturing and positive surroundings.</p>



<p>A conducive environment for children must include these integral
resources and Salaam Baalak Trust, a well-known non-profit organization in
India, ensures it. SBT rescues and reunites children with their respective
families, or places them at SBT’s Children’s Homes. SBT also ensures that
children are well looked after and have an opportunity to engage in
extra-curricular activities like sports, performing arts etc.</p>



<p>This Independence Day, you can grab the opportunity to celebrate
the true spirit of the occasion by helping SBT protect children. They deserve
to attend school and have a good job in the future. So, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for&nbsp;children’s

<p>The first wave of COVID-19 was extremely tough for the world, including India. People across the country were battling with the many repercussions of the pandemic – be it the effects of the lockdown, loss of jobs, lack of integral resources etc.</p>



<p>The situation seemed to get a tad better but it only worsened as the second wave hit India. The grave situation has brought about a lot of struggle, especially for the COVID-affected patients and their families. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a> are one of the worst-hit communities in India during these troubled times. Millions of children live on the streets where they fend for themselves and works towards finding basic meals, a safe shelter, medical resources, regular education etc. In these difficult times, such resources are even harder to access.</p>



<p>Besides these utilities, underprivileged children and their
families are not finding healthcare facilities or other everyday essentials
that are much-needed during these tough months.</p>



<p>Below are some of the requirements that can help improve the
situation a bit for underprivileged communities:</p>



<p>Awareness sessions are much required as sensitisation can help
bust the many myths surrounding COVID-19, its effects, and the aftermath. Such
sessions will also help the community members understand how to protect
themselves and take necessary safety precautions. The drives will help guide
people who are unaware of the essential steps to take once someone in their family
is infected – they must know how to manage the illness at home and ensure it is
not spread further.</p>



<p>Providing ration and medical kits to families is a must! From
medicines to an oxygen supply, from hospital beds to mid-day meals, children
are in urgent need of such resources that must be accessible to them.</p>



<p>There are innumerable street and working children who are
ignored, abused, and severely affected by the second wave of the pandemic.
Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most trusted non-profit organisations in India,
is working every day to help ensure that children are protected and lead a life
of dignity and care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate
for children’s medical aid</a>
and other support right away!</p>

<p>Many children in India are victims of child labour, child trafficking, and child abuse. There are many atrocities that they face due to unsupervised living and in the company of shady characters that are looking after their vested interests. All children require responsible and helpful mentors to help guide them through troubles, life lessons, and other learning experiences. </p>



<p>The impact of abuse of any sort can leave a long-lasting imprint on the psyche of children. It can have severe and unexpected effects on the personality of the children as well. Without love and care, children feel lost and have a difficult time dealing with the many changes around them, and such horrific incidents can hamper their development in many ways.</p>



<p>Many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>&nbsp;end up resorting to drugs to handle the pressure of dealing with abuse while others join gangs or the company of untoward people on the streets to feel somewhat safe and protected. In reality, they are anything but safe as they often begin participating in illegal activities like selling drugs, pick-pocketing etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positive and productive environment, proper infrastructure, and generous care are basic needs for underprivileged children who have lived on the streets. They also require basic education, healthcare facilities, safe shelter, and responsible adults around them to support and encourage them. Extra-curricular activities are also essential to help nurture children and give them the platform to express themselves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organization in India, works relentlessly to provide all of the aforementioned facilities at the SBT shelter homes for boys and girls. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working in the area of children’s welfare for the last several decades. They have rescued and rehabilitated several children and even reunited many of them with their families. Such efforts have improved the lives of many children and given a new lease to them where they have grown up to have successful careers. You can also support SBT’s programs and support underprivileged children by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and also availing a 50% tax deduction under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.

<p>We all know about the existence of street children in India. Their presence is apparent to everyone yet most of us to choose to ignore them. It is a deplorable state of affairs to see how children, who require constant and an abundance of support, are deprived of basic resources and mentorship. They roam around the streets to fend for themselves. They may even be seen working odd jobs at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>, rag-picking at railway stations, shoe cleaning in busy streets, or even begging at temples and bus stands etc.</p>



<p>Many people try to&nbsp;rescue street children,&nbsp;temporarily, by giving them some money or a meal to eat. This is an act of kindness but one that is hardly part of the solution. Some people even think that employing poor children at their homes to do the domestic chores will help, when in fact, it is an act of engaging in child labour. This contributes to more harm than good and affects the psychological and physical well-being of the child.&nbsp;It is to be noted that no child must ever engage in any sort of labour. These impressionable years require for children to study, play with other children of their age group, participate in extra-curricular activities, watch informative visual content etc. Instead, rescuing&nbsp;abandoned street children&nbsp;becomes an even more distant dream when the plight of their street life is observed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many individuals, government agencies and non-profit organizations in India that are working hard to improve the struggles of street children and help provide them with short-term and/or long-term support. One of the NGOs that is known to offer generous support and a commendable platform to underprivileged children is Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi. This non-profit has been working in the respective field for more than 30 years and has protected many children by placing them in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter for street children</a>. The children are offered nutritious meals, a safe shelter, nurturing guardians, and playmates of their age for them to uplift the quality of their life. You can also help Salaam Baalak Trust in their endeavour to empower street children and ensure that they lead happier and healthier lives. So wait no more and join in to help more children lead a life without hardships and sufferings. Donate now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Untitled-design.jpg" alt="reconnecting children with their families" class="wp-image-142"/></figure>



<p>Several street children can be found on the streets of Delhi. Their living conditions are deplorable due to the deprivation of necessities. Children are left to fend for themselves in an environment that is hostile, unsafe, and poverty-ridden. Read on to know some of the basic resources required in the lives of all children but missing in the lives of street children:</p>



<p>Safe Shelter<br>All children must live in an environment that looks after their basic living needs, i.e. residing in a place that is clean and welcoming. Every child deserves to live in a safe zone that caters to their well-being and makes them feel at ease so that they can focus on building their personality and participating in extra-curricular activities. A positive home plays a major role in a child’s life as it takes away the pressure of dealing with suspicious characters, and even shield them from mental health issues and other medical issues.</p>



<p>Regular Meals<br>Every child requires healthy and nutritious meals daily so that their mind and body remain active and nourished. Children need proper meals during their childhood days but if they are deprived of food, which is a harsh reality in the lives of street children, they can develop life-long health issues.   </p>



<p>Education Opportunities<br>It is said that education is one of the keys to the problems of many life issues. But those issues multiply if children are not allowed to attend regular schools and access quality education. Children learn a great deal from their textbooks and teachers. They also get to spend time with their school-mates to learn and absorb the concept of healthy social dynamics from a tender age. But lack of education stunts the learning graph and deprives children of several opportunities in life due to constricted knowledge.</p>



<p>Street children also have basic rights and they must be met as children are the future of every country. Children contribute to the development and well-being of nations. Salaam Baalak Trust (SBT), a non profit organization, is based in Delhi and has been working for the welfare of street children for several years. SBT offers <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter for street children </a>to help rehabilitate them in a positive environment. The NGO also focuses on <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">reconnecting children with their families</a><strong>,</strong> in cases where they got lost and have no contact or means to live with their family. You can also contribute to the endeavour by supporting Salaam Baalak Trust. Donate now and make a difference.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Help-Children-Utilize-Time-At-Home-During-COVID-19.jpg" alt="Utilize Time At Home During COVID-19" class="wp-image-132"/></figure>



<p>The world is currently facing a tough time due to the outbreak of COVID-19, also known as ‘coronavirus’. There is a lockdown in most countries and people are required to stay indoors and keep all physical contacts to a bare minimum. The pandemic has compelled the governments of most countries to urge people to follow these rules for their well-being and take preventive measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Several people have been digitally sharing their experiences regarding staying indoors, including India where the government recently implemented a 21-day lockdown across the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children, in particular, have been quite affected by the
disruption in their everyday schedule and the changing environment. Especially
at that age, most children are quite aware that there is an undercurrent of
discomfort among the adults and a change in their overall lifestyle. The
schools are also closed and children are not allowed to go out to play or
engage with their friends and classmates. This has surely left them with a lot
of free time at home and making a lot of children feel restless and anxious.
The parents must address these issues head-on instead of tip-toeing around the
situation. Children must be updated about why there is a sudden regulation in
the house, obviously according to the age and understanding of the respective
child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important thing to remember for parents is to make the most
of this time and carry out productive activities in the house to keep a check
on the adrenaline levels of the children. Read on to know about some ways to
bring down the stress levels at home and help children during these unforeseen
times.</p>



<p>Plan a Schedule<br>Children naturally feel more at ease when there is a schedule in place as it keeps them busy and tackles with any boredom that might creep in during a lockdown. A daily routine for learning, playtime, DIY activities, reading hour and quizzes etc shall make for a wholesome day.</p>



<p>Emotionally Strong<br>Children are quite receptive to their surroundings. That is why it is important to balance their emotional levels by spreading more positive and healthy energies in the house. Spending quality family time and reconnecting with relatives online, and ensuring the grandparents are connected with the child, be it at home or digitally, is a great way to keep up their spirits.  </p>



<p>There are several underprivileged children on the streets who are getting affected the most as they continue to be deprived of basic resources like food, clothing and shelter. Salaam Baalak Trust, a non profit organization in New Delhi works towards providing a safe shelter, healthy meals, and quality education. Especially during the pandemic, SBT is helping families receive medical care via its community program team and Childline team. Sanitisation kits and food is also being distributed among several disadvantaged communities across Delhi. SBT continues its work of rescuing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> and providing tools for their rehabilitation. You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to the education of children</a>&nbsp;and help children lead better lives. </p>
