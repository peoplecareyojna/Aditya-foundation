<p>Many children in India are victims of child labour, child trafficking, and child abuse. There are many atrocities that they face due to unsupervised living and in the company of shady characters that are looking after their vested interests. All children require responsible and helpful mentors to help guide them through troubles, life lessons, and other learning experiences. </p>



<p>The impact of abuse of any sort can leave a long-lasting imprint on the psyche of children. It can have severe and unexpected effects on the personality of the children as well. Without love and care, children feel lost and have a difficult time dealing with the many changes around them, and such horrific incidents can hamper their development in many ways.</p>



<p>Many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>&nbsp;end up resorting to drugs to handle the pressure of dealing with abuse while others join gangs or the company of untoward people on the streets to feel somewhat safe and protected. In reality, they are anything but safe as they often begin participating in illegal activities like selling drugs, pick-pocketing etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positive and productive environment, proper infrastructure, and generous care are basic needs for underprivileged children who have lived on the streets. They also require basic education, healthcare facilities, safe shelter, and responsible adults around them to support and encourage them. Extra-curricular activities are also essential to help nurture children and give them the platform to express themselves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organization in India, works relentlessly to provide all of the aforementioned facilities at the SBT shelter homes for boys and girls. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working in the area of children’s welfare for the last several decades. They have rescued and rehabilitated several children and even reunited many of them with their families. Such efforts have improved the lives of many children and given a new lease to them where they have grown up to have successful careers. You can also support SBT’s programs and support underprivileged children by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and also availing a 50% tax deduction under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.

<p>There millions of children living on the streets of India. This is a harsh reality that must be improved for the betterment of the youth. The tumultuous surroundings of street children are daunting and unpredictable. Children are surrounded by adversity and shortage of all resources. Be it a safe shelter, basic education, medical facilities, or mentoring, street children do not have access to any of these essential tools to lead a happy, healthy, and productive childhood. Instead, the dark underbelly of India’s streets offers negative experiences like abuse, exploitation, violence, and depravity.</p>



<p>Street children run away from their homes due to varied reasons
revolving around discouraging circumstances but they end up in even worse
situations. Many children end up participating in child labour to survive on
the streets alone. The hours are long and the wages are the bare minimum,
besides the toll it takes on their mental and physical well-being. Several
hazardous conditions can also be found in factories where children are employed
which may have immediate as well as a long-term negative effect on them. Many
underprivileged children work as domestic help too, and what makes it worse is
that it is socially acceptable in many homes.</p>



<p>In an effort to survive on the rough streets, many children end
up engaging in illegal activities which only worsen their condition. Many
children take hard drugs too and the dependency on such chemicals makes them even
more susceptible to “do whatever it takes” for the next hit. Several children
on the streets are prone to drug abuse which is rather unfortunate as it
steadily dwindles their opportunities of a brighter and healthier future.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">Rescuing street children </a>is integral as they are the future of India. Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed non-profit organisation that provides a sensitive and caring environment for street and working children. The efforts of SBT help provide a platform for children to realize their full potential, offer them their right to a safe and secure space, and give access to education, health and nutrition. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong> </strong>to help make a difference in their lives and improve their chances of a prosperous future.</p>
