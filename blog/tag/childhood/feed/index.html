<p>All children deserve a life that includes basic resources, protection, encouragement, and opportunities to grow. Their birth-right includes utilities as well as a wholesome environment that helps them prosper and constantly strive for excellence.</p>



<p>A conducive environment for children also includes one where
they are surrounded by mentors and other encouraging adults who guide them and
support them through all hurdles and milestones. Regular schooling, hot and
nutritious meals that they have access to at least thrice a day, a safe
shelter, and quality healthcare facilities are some of the resources that play
a pivotal role in all children’s lives. These are all necessities that help
them in many ways to lead a happy childhood and strive for a better future.</p>



<p>But in the case of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>, the reality is quite different. There is a dearth of material and emotional support, and what makes matters worse is that they need to fend for themselves in an unforgiving and tough world on the streets.</p>



<p>Deprived of mental health and tools to handle difficult
situations does not help their cause either. From facing everyday challenges
alone to falling into the traps of substance abuse, many factors play a part in
the deteriorating conditions of underprivileged children. Some children also
end up participating in child labour where they work long hours as daily wage
earners for minimum pay. This affects them mentally, physically, and
emotionally, and also depletes their chances of landing a stable and
well-paying job in the future.</p>



<p>One of the most reputed non-profit organisations is Salaam Baalak Trust that has been working to rescue and rehabilitate street and working children. You can donate for <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">children’s medical ai</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">d</a></strong> and help SBT ensure that abandoned children have a better childhood and a promising future.</p>



<p>The NGO runs shelter homes and many child-centric programs to
help provide essential resources for children. SBT also provides love and care,
besides running mental health programs to help with de-addiction and other
trauma that children are afflicted with from their time on the streets. So wait
no more and donate to Salaam Baalak Trust today!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_3506.jpg" alt="Mental Health Of Street Children" class="wp-image-192"/></figure>



<p>Mental health is getting more attention in the mainstream media in recent years – a welcome change as it signals that more people are becoming aware of the causes and impact of mental health. Innumerable people suffer silently and fight on their own, without any professional help or the support of their family and/or friends.</p>



<p>The situation is even worse for street children in India, one of
the most vulnerable groups that are often given little or no attention.
Children living on the streets and working children (engaged in child labour)
live in an environment that is not conducive for their growth.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Street children (opens in a new tab)">Street children</a> live in high-stress surroundings, constantly looking for basic utilities like food, shelter, clothing, and even a support system to depend on. Many of the rescued street children are known to experience anxiety, sleeplessness, anger and trust issues, and even end up having dependency issues due to substance abuse. Many children face domestic abuse at home and run away from their homes to search for a better environment while other children face varied types of abuse (mental, physical, emotional) on the streets – all of these leave a deep and long-lasting impact on the psyche that must be addressed and resolved. Children are quite impressionable during their formative years and require gentle and protective mentors around them to guide them through these early phases.</p>



<p>To help children have a hopeful and positive future, Salaam
Baalak Trust, one of the top NGOs in India, rescues and rehabilitates children
at their centres. They are provided with immense support, care, and essential
resources (medical facilities, access to extra-curricular activities etc) to
help them build a prosperous future. Several children who get lost or are
separated from their families are also reconnected if possible, and get a
second chance to a happier childhood.</p>



<p>You
can support the efforts of Salaam Baalak Trust and help improve the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health
of street children</a>. Donate for children’s overall development to ensure
their well-being. Generously contribute to Salaam Baalak Trust right away!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-76" src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20-Aug-1.jpg" alt="street children" width="943" height="417"></p>
<p>Adolescence can be a period of great emotional torment, not only for the child but also for the family. Confused due to&nbsp;various bodily changes, a child often experiments with the development of their personality before a coherent identity is&nbsp;formed. How children see the world is bound to be framed, primarily and directly, by what they experience at home.&nbsp;Sensitive care-giving can thus help form a safe internal and external world.</p>
<p>In its absence,&nbsp;however, a child can find his or herself grappling with fragile emotional health, more so when the child has to witness parental divorce.</p>
<p>Radhika*&nbsp;arrived at Salaam Baalak Trust<strong><b>&nbsp;</b></strong>in a similar state of vulnerability. Forced to take responsibility of her siblings at 13, she found herself clueless about her father&#8217;s sudden abandonment. Vacant eyes, dishevelled appearance and muted responses to the counsellor were enough to indicate that something was amiss. For the first three weeks,&nbsp;her interaction was limited to another girl&nbsp;who was&nbsp;two years’ her senior. She would pick leaves from&nbsp;plants, chew the skin on her fingers and avoid conversations. In the NFE&nbsp;(Non-Formal Education)&nbsp;classes,&nbsp;she would often be found lost and oblivious to the teacher. Indifferent to the contents on TV,&nbsp;Radhika&nbsp;would often be found blankly staring at the screen; even the study table where she sat had violent graving&nbsp;from geometry instruments.</p>
<p>In the second month,&nbsp;the breakthrough happened&nbsp;when Radhika&nbsp;was given the task to distribute lunch. This was the first time she responded to the social worker without resistance. The act of giving nutrition had created a thaw in her otherwise impervious demeanour. She was praised and encouraged by the coordinator of the shelter home. With time,&nbsp;she began to revel in the various duties of the centre, often taking initiative to clean the environment. Gradually she was&nbsp;found combing hair of girls who were junior to her and watering plants she had earlier picked leaves from. These activities went in tandem with the clinical work of the counsellor,&nbsp;in consultation with the psychiatrist. With attention to small but significant milestones, she finally began to confide in the counsellor. From monosyllabic utterance to casual gossip and complains,&nbsp;the clouds of diagnosed depression were lifting. The medicines helped enable&nbsp;the psychotherapeutic process to take deeper effect.</p>
<p>Four months in, Radhika started to actively participate in quizzes, group sessions and classes. Her nurturing personality won her many friends who would seek her&nbsp;out&nbsp;all day long.&nbsp;&#8220;Radhika Didi&#8221; finally and firmly established herself as an indispensable part of the community, leading by example and healing those in need.</p>
<p>The sessions revealed that her mother&nbsp;lived in a hostel in the city with other two children and worked as a housemaid.&nbsp;Radhika was&nbsp;admitted by her&nbsp;mother&nbsp;in the hope for a better life and with full belief in Radhika&#8217;s resilience. During family counselling sessions,&nbsp;the collective trauma of the family was unpacked and sensitively processed. Growing from strength to strength,&nbsp;Radhika gained admission in&nbsp;a regular school and went on to score 75 percent in her 12th grade. She&nbsp;also&nbsp;went on to pursue her graduation through the Vahani scholarship at IP University and won a Gandhi Fellowship where she would get paid to teach underprivileged kids. Parallelly,&nbsp;Radhika has gained admission in the prestigious TISS (Tata Institute of Social Sciences) to pursue a Master&#8217;s program in Social Work,&nbsp;with a focus on Dalit and Tribal Studies.</p>
<p>Radhika now&nbsp;has to choose between the prospect of teaching or&nbsp;studying a Master&#8217;s program. Thus,&nbsp;from a child whose life hit rock bottom,&nbsp;Radhika is now spoilt for choice between two meaningful career prospects.</p>
<p>The choice,&nbsp;as always,&nbsp;remains hers. As for the kids at the centre, &#8220;Radhika Didi&#8221; would continue to inspire the community of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/"><span style="color: #333333;">street children</span></a>&nbsp;for years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>*name changed to protect the child’s identity</p>

<p>In the face of abandonment and abuse early in life, millions of children are found living on the streets of India every year. In various nooks and corners of the country, homeless children are desperately hunting for stability and security, in terms of food, shelter and clothing. Most children do not understand that besides these essentials, other integral components required in their lives are education, healthcare and access to other extra-curricular activities to enhance their minds as well as protect their bodies. But why would children be aware of this &#8211; it is the job of adults to provide such resources for children to cash upon.</p>
<p><strong><b>Finding a Solution<br />
</b></strong>We all come across children who are beggars, hawkers, working at small shops, or even caught stealing and other such crimes. As bystanders, are we really participating in the solution to this deep-rooted problem that the society is suffering from. Children are meant to be the future of the country and yet, they are struggling to find their next meal, every day.</p>
<p>Over 30 years ago, Salaam Baalak Trust came up with a solution. A model that changed the lives of thousands of children in the country. SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/projects.php"><u>rescues abandoned children</u></a> to provide them with a safe and sensitive environment that focuses on their growth.</p>
<p>Mainly, it works towards removing the walls of judgement towards disadvantaged children in society. Among other programs, SBT also provides full time and short-stay facilities for homeless children, a much-needed support system that continues to save lives of many children.</p>
<p><strong><b>Take a Step<br />
</b></strong>Besides educational aids, SBT believes in giving children a platform to showcase their artistic side. Studies also show that children from abused backgrounds stabilise faster with the support of performing arts and other creative mediums, like dance, theatre, painting etc. The <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php"><u>mental health of street children</u></a> begins to heal eventually.</p>
<p>Let’s not turn a blind eye, and let’s definitely not sit idle while children suffer from loneliness and lack of basic amenities. Start by becoming an ambassador of goodness, via time, skills or monetary support. Visit Salaam Baalak Trust’s social media platforms to keep yourself updated, and join the revolution.</p>
