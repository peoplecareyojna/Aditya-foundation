<p>In the bustling streets of India, where life&#8217;s challenges are evident, a safe shelter emerges as a beacon of hope for the most vulnerable among us &#8211; street and working children. These shelters serve as sanctuaries, providing a haven from the harsh realities they face daily.</p>



<p>A safe shelter offers these
children more than just a roof over their heads; it provides a nurturing
environment where their physical, emotional, and psychological well-being is
prioritised. Here, they find solace in the dangers of the streets, shielding
them from exploitation, abuse, and the perils of a life without protection.</p>



<p>Within these sanctuaries,
marginalised children are granted access to education, healthcare, and
nutrition &#8211; basic rights that are often out of reach for those living on the
streets. This protective cocoon empowers them with the tools they need to break
free from the cycle of poverty and build a brighter future.</p>



<p>Moreover, safe shelters foster a
sense of belonging and community among these children. Surrounded by other
children of their age group who share similar experiences, they form bonds that
provide emotional support and companionship. This supportive network instills a
sense of hope, confidence, and self-worth, crucial elements for their personal
growth and development.</p>



<p>As these children flourish within
the protective embrace of a safe shelter, their potential begins to unfold.
With access to education and skills training, they gain the means to chase
their dreams and unlock their full potential. They become equipped to navigate
the challenges that once seemed insurmountable, propelling them towards a
future brimming with promise.</p>



<p>In essence, a safe shelter is
more than just a physical structure; it is a sanctuary that breathes life into
the aspirations and dreams of marginalised and at-risk children. It offers them
a chance to thrive, to rise above adversity, and to become the architects of
their own destiny. It is a testament to the transformative power of compassion,
protection, and opportunity.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an esteemed <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi NCR</a>, provides a safe
haven for vulnerable children. Their shelters, including a <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">girls&#8217;
residential home in Gurugram</a>, offer protection, education, and a nurturing
community. Support their vital work by donating today. Together, we can empower
these children to break free from adversity and build a brighter tomorrow.</p>

<p>Street children are a reality and their existence must be acknowledged as a first step. There are millions of children living on the streets of India, without any adult supervision or support from society. These children are deprived of any of the basic rights – they do not have access to proper education, daily meals, healthcare facilities, or a safe shelter. The children are either runaways, orphans, have cut ties with their family, or are unable to locate them and have no other option but to live on the streets.</p>



<p>All of these children live on their own – they work odd jobs to gather some basic earnings to live off on the streets. Be it in factories or at restaurants, children are employed for odd jobs where their wages are bare minimum and their rights are compromised. Child labour is a major issue in India as children work in unhealthy and unsafe environments. At the age when they should be studying in schools and playing with other children of their age, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> put their lives in danger on a daily basis to earn money. Their mental, physical, and psychological well-being is attacked and deteriorates due to such circumstances.</p>



<p>Children’s mental health also gets affected as children need to be in a healthy environment. They deserve a safe and protected atmosphere to grow properly and healthily. Regular medical tests are also important that must include timely vaccinations. Immunizations can help protect children from avoidable diseases as avoiding these can even affect them for life, or worse, cause death.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children deserve to be around positive, encouraging, and supportive adults. They must be given playtime and tools to grow up to be independent and wholesome individuals. Many non-profit organizations are working to improve the lives of children. Salaam Baalak Trust is a renowned NGO that has been working for over 30 years to rescue and rehabilitate children. SBT is ensuring that children receive food, security, health, education and love – essentials required for children to grow up well. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a> and help make a real difference in their lives. Support Salaam Baalak Trust now!</p>

<p>Street children can be found all over India &#8211; at bus stops, railways stations, dark alleys, poverty-stricken colonies, highways etc. Their existence is often ignored by the privileged ones but that needs to stop. After all, a country’s progress is defined by how the youth is progressing, and the reality of street children is deplorable. Millions of children live without adult supervision or any sort of essential resources. They do not have access to monetary or mental support to help navigate life and grow in a healthy environment.</p>



<p>15th August is here! A special day for Indians across the globe as Independence Day is celebrated with much pride and pomp. This day cannot be commemorated without acknowledging the issue and vowing to be more rigorous in protecting underprivileged children. Their plight needs to heard and resolved in more ways than one. From everyday violence to life-threatening scenarios, from zero accountability to illegal activities, from acute poverty to lack of any scope of a healthy and happy future, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>, like all other children, deserve a better life.</p>



<p>Some basic resources help lead a quality life for everyone,
including underprivileged children who do not have these aids. These include
quality education, regular and nutritious meals, proper healthcare facilities,
and a safe shelter. Children also require love, care, protection, and mental
health support to grow in nurturing and positive surroundings.</p>



<p>A conducive environment for children must include these integral
resources and Salaam Baalak Trust, a well-known non-profit organization in
India, ensures it. SBT rescues and reunites children with their respective
families, or places them at SBT’s Children’s Homes. SBT also ensures that
children are well looked after and have an opportunity to engage in
extra-curricular activities like sports, performing arts etc.</p>



<p>This Independence Day, you can grab the opportunity to celebrate
the true spirit of the occasion by helping SBT protect children. They deserve
to attend school and have a good job in the future. So, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for&nbsp;children’s
medical aid</a>&nbsp;and help Salaam Baalak Trust run its programs for the
welfare of children. Support now!</p>

<p>The first wave of COVID-19 was extremely tough for the world, including India. People across the country were battling with the many repercussions of the pandemic – be it the effects of the lockdown, loss of jobs, lack of integral resources etc.</p>



<p>The situation seemed to get a tad better but it only worsened as the second wave hit India. The grave situation has brought about a lot of struggle, especially for the COVID-affected patients and their families. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a> are one of the worst-hit communities in India during these troubled times. Millions of children live on the streets where they fend for themselves and works towards finding basic meals, a safe shelter, medical resources, regular education etc. In these difficult times, such resources are even harder to access.</p>



<p>Besides these utilities, underprivileged children and their
families are not finding healthcare facilities or other everyday essentials
that are much-needed during these tough months.</p>



<p>Below are some of the requirements that can help improve the
situation a bit for underprivileged communities:</p>



<p>Awareness sessions are much required as sensitisation can help
bust the many myths surrounding COVID-19, its effects, and the aftermath. Such
sessions will also help the community members understand how to protect
themselves and take necessary safety precautions. The drives will help guide
people who are unaware of the essential steps to take once someone in their family
is infected – they must know how to manage the illness at home and ensure it is
not spread further.</p>



<p>Providing ration and medical kits to families is a must! From
medicines to an oxygen supply, from hospital beds to mid-day meals, children
are in urgent need of such resources that must be accessible to them.</p>



<p>There are innumerable street and working children who are
ignored, abused, and severely affected by the second wave of the pandemic.
Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most trusted non-profit organisations in India,
is working every day to help ensure that children are protected and lead a life
of dignity and care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate
for children’s medical aid</a>
and other support right away!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Help-Children-Utilize-Time-At-Home-During-COVID-19.jpg" alt="Utilize Time At Home During COVID-19" class="wp-image-132"/></figure>



<p>The world is currently facing a tough time due to the outbreak of COVID-19, also known as ‘coronavirus’. There is a lockdown in most countries and people are required to stay indoors and keep all physical contacts to a bare minimum. The pandemic has compelled the governments of most countries to urge people to follow these rules for their well-being and take preventive measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Several people have been digitally sharing their experiences regarding staying indoors, including India where the government recently implemented a 21-day lockdown across the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children, in particular, have been quite affected by the
disruption in their everyday schedule and the changing environment. Especially
at that age, most children are quite aware that there is an undercurrent of
discomfort among the adults and a change in their overall lifestyle. The
schools are also closed and children are not allowed to go out to play or
engage with their friends and classmates. This has surely left them with a lot
of free time at home and making a lot of children feel restless and anxious.
The parents must address these issues head-on instead of tip-toeing around the
situation. Children must be updated about why there is a sudden regulation in
the house, obviously according to the age and understanding of the respective
child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important thing to remember for parents is to make the most
of this time and carry out productive activities in the house to keep a check
on the adrenaline levels of the children. Read on to know about some ways to
bring down the stress levels at home and help children during these unforeseen
times.</p>



<p>Plan a Schedule<br>Children naturally feel more at ease when there is a schedule in place as it keeps them busy and tackles with any boredom that might creep in during a lockdown. A daily routine for learning, playtime, DIY activities, reading hour and quizzes etc shall make for a wholesome day.</p>



<p>Emotionally Strong<br>Children are quite receptive to their surroundings. That is why it is important to balance their emotional levels by spreading more positive and healthy energies in the house. Spending quality family time and reconnecting with relatives online, and ensuring the grandparents are connected with the child, be it at home or digitally, is a great way to keep up their spirits.  </p>



<p>There are several underprivileged children on the streets who are getting affected the most as they continue to be deprived of basic resources like food, clothing and shelter. Salaam Baalak Trust, a non profit organization in New Delhi works towards providing a safe shelter, healthy meals, and quality education. Especially during the pandemic, SBT is helping families receive medical care via its community program team and Childline team. Sanitisation kits and food is also being distributed among several disadvantaged communities across Delhi. SBT continues its work of rescuing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> and providing tools for their rehabilitation. You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to the education of children</a>&nbsp;and help children lead better lives. </p>

<p>More often than not, our perception of people is settled in the very first meeting. That impression seldom abandons the person it is attached to. The same is the case with the street children&nbsp;who are given intervention by&nbsp;SBT. People often take one look at them and assign a rigid personality to them.&nbsp;Some look at these children and say that they are incurable of their mischievousness, that they are thieves or worse still, that they are drug addicts. It is very easy to judge these children and freeze their impressions in our minds. What we forget to look for are the experiences that led them there. </p>



<p>Keeping this in mind, there is a story that needs to be shared &#8211;&nbsp;Not too long ago,&nbsp;a boy was born. His beginning in the world also signalled the end of his parent’s relationship. The parents left this infant to his maternal grandmother, and then both of them got married and left the infant, going two separate ways. The child had now become the responsibility of his maternal uncle (mama) and his grandma (naani). As the&nbsp;child began to grow, some behavioural issues began to be visible. He was aggressive and had a penchant for getting into fights, he stole and also developed a drug habit at&nbsp;that impressionable age.&nbsp;He was enrolled in a school, but that too led to more complaints of the same behaviour. After having tried everything they could think of, the two guardians decided&nbsp;to throw this child out of the house. But having raised the child, the grandma couldn’t bear to leave the child homeless and helpless. Not wanting to ruin this child’s life, the grandma decided to take the child back to his father. </p>



<p>If this change was for the better or worse, one couldn’t have said at the moment. Once there, he would get into arguments with his step-mother and even get beaten up by his father at times. These circumstances led him to one day leave his home and go&nbsp;to the New Delhi Railway Station. Somehow, he landed in one of SBT’s shelters called Aasara and&nbsp;was&nbsp;later moved to DMRC Children’s&nbsp;Home&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter homes</a>).&nbsp;After coming to DMRC, he was enrolled in a school, and his interest in studies helped. </p>



<p>By the time he arrived at DMRC, his behavioural and emotional issues were left&nbsp;uncharted. He continued taking drugs, starting unsolicited fights&nbsp;etc. He couldn’t maintain peer relationships and sometimes had anger outbursts. All this while, a seed of incessant hatred toward his family and parents grew in his heart. Can anyone blame him for that?&nbsp;He never wanted to see his two guardians again. All of these accumulated issues&nbsp;brought him to SBT’s Mental Health Program (MHP). The moment he was taken in, it was realised that the child needed medication and intensive therapy. Both these things greatly benefited him and after some time,&nbsp;the child started feeling better and taking more interest in academics. But the therapy had just begun. The next stop at this Therapy Express was the Channelling Station. Often children with cruel and inhospitable backgrounds are unable to express their emotions, yet the emotional volcano continues to build within them, exploding as behavioural issues.&nbsp;Therapy helps&nbsp;these children find a channel through which they can express. This child was introduced to the theatre, so he could channel his energy. As this new road of his life began to take shape, an older road showed its foreboding face.</p>



<p>The child suddenly withdrew from his medication and to a lay man’s eyes, went back to the starting line. The same anger outbursts, drug habits and behavioural issues began again. This time the fall felt much harder. He had been here before, but to come back here was more painful than he could&nbsp;have envisioned. He was immediately put back on medication and under supervision. His therapy focussed on the deep seated anger he had and tried to guide him to a place where he could manage it better. Therapists worked with him on forgiving the past and also taught him ways to avoid drugs and other addictive substances. All this while, he was made aware of how his anger outburst and his need for a high&nbsp;may have&nbsp;one alternative&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;theatre. He was made aware of how theatre could provide him with path to deal with his conflicts and emotions. </p>



<p>He continued to be on medication and in therapy, while at the same time he pursued theatre. His prowess on stage earned him a chance to go to Scotland in 2014 and perform in the International Theatre Festival during the Commonwealth Games. Just before he left for this grand performance, he went back to see his guardians (his grandma and uncle). It was a point in his life where he had found happiness, tangible as a chair or table, and he has grasped it. He started making and maintaining relationships, healing old wounds and mending bitter ties. </p>



<p>Today he teaches theatre to SBT children and is also a part of SBT’s Old Delhi Walk team, while continuing his studies and trying to master English speaking for his professional life. He sees his future as a filmmaker. With the world as his oyster and SBT having his back, we wish this child the best of luck!</p>
