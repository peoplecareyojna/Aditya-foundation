<p>In a world where the marginalised are deprived of their basic rights, it falls upon the privileged communities to extend a helping hand to at-risk groups and uplift their current circumstances. Among these vulnerable groups, children bear the brunt of dire conditions on the streets, subjecting them to physical, mental, and emotional hardships. Thus, it is imperative to address their medical needs and provide them with the necessary support.</p>



<p>Street children
endure unimaginable hardships, lacking access to basic necessities, healthcare,
and protection. They face numerous hazards, including malnutrition, abuse,
exploitation, and poor living conditions, which jeopardise their well-being and
future prospects. Urgent action is needed to address their medical needs and
offer them a lifeline.</p>



<p>There are many
government initiatives, individuals, and the efforts of dedicated organisations
that are creating a safer and healthier environment for street and working
children. Through medical camps, outreach programmes, and collaborations with
healthcare professionals, these organisations aim to provide essential medical
attention to these children. By focusing on multifaceted approaches, they seek
to meet the urgent medical requirements of these vulnerable children.</p>

a trusted <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi,</a> works for the welfare of street and working children in
India. The transformative organisation provides essential services like
healthcare, education, and shelter to underprivileged children. SBT empowers
