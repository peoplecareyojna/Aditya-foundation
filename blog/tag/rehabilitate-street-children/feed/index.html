<p>Street children are those who are forced to live on the streets due to poverty, neglect, or abuse. These children are exposed to a wide range of dangers, such as violence, sexual abuse, and substance abuse. To ensure their safety and well-being, it is essential to provide them with a safe shelter.</p>



<p>The plight of street
children is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. These children are
often forced to work in hazardous conditions, beg for food and money, and face
the threat of violence and abuse daily. Child labour is still a rampant
practice that must be addressed and resolved.</p>



<p>Without a safe
shelter, these children are exposed to a variety of dangers, including
exploitation, trafficking, and violence. In addition to physical dangers, these
children are also at risk of developing mental health issues such as depression
and anxiety, which can have long-term effects on their overall development.</p>



<p>Providing street
children with a safe shelter is crucial to protecting and supporting them. Safe
shelters can provide a temporary home for these children and offer them
protection from the dangers of the streets. They can also provide them with
access to necessities such as food, clothing, and healthcare, as well as
education and vocational training.</p>



<p>Safe shelters can
also provide a sense of stability and support for these children, allowing them
to develop healthy relationships and social skills. This can help them to
transition back into society and lead successful, productive lives.</p>



<p>In the case of young
girls, many of them hail from villages and hamlets and wind up on the streets
of big cities. Many of these girls have either fled their homes or got
separated from them. They are often victims of trafficking, kidnapping, or
domestic violence. For girls surviving on the streets alone, each day is filled
with numerous difficulties and dangers. They frequently face instances of
sexual assault, physical abuse, and efforts to coerce them into prostitution. These
girls yearn to be under a roof where they can rest soundly at night.</p>



<p>This is why
governments, NGOs, and individuals must work together to ensure that street
children are protected, supported, and given the resources, they need to
succeed. This includes providing safe shelters, educational facilities,
healthcare, and job training, as well as addressing the underlying issues that
force children onto the streets.</p>



<p>Salaam Balaak Trust,
a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charitable trust in Delhi</a>, offers a sensitive and nurturing setting for street and
working children and other vulnerable children. It aims to offer children a
place where they can realise their full potential and have access to a safe
shelter, an education, and good health and nutrition. So, wait no more and make
an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online donation in India</a>&nbsp;to support India&#8217;s children and give them a
promising future.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-1024x683.jpg" alt="World Mental Health Day" class="wp-image-246" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Children on the streets have a tough time living a life of distress and deprivation. They are also going through a lot of uncertainty and more often than not, that ends up affecting their mental well-being. This is because street life can be extremely distressing to a child’s impressionable mind.</p>



<p>This is the age when children need to be well looked after. Instead, they have to live without any basic necessities and make several life choices on a daily basis. These integral resources include a safe shelter, quality healthcare services, hot and nutritious meals, regular education etc. But the reality is far from this, as we know. Children have to fend for themselves and typically, they end up getting stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty, illiteracy, child labour, and other forms of exploitation etc.</p>



<p>Mental health is an essential topic in the case of underprivileged children and must be addressed. There are many areas of concern when it comes to the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health of street children</a>. They may go through depression, substance abuse, anxiety, sleeplessness etc. After all, surviving on your own from a tender age can be a severely disturbing issue for a child. This is why regular medical check-ups must be conducted to ensure no mental health issue is overlooked as that may worsen the situation.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children also require proper medical support and Salaam Baalak Trust has been working relentlessly to rescue and <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/restoration.php">rehabilitate street children</a>. The non-profit organisation also ensures that there are proper records of children’s medical history of diseases, check-ups and treatments to ensure they receive the best of medical support. Regular health camps are also conducted for the children to spread awareness on the importance of good health and ensure that children’s health is not neglected anymore.</p>



<p>10th October
is commemorated as World Mental Health Day. You can generously donate for
children and ensure they are provided with proper medical support, safety and
protection, to ensure they have a positive and promising future. Join hands
with Salaam Balaak Trust and gift children a better childhood!</p>
