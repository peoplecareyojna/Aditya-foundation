<p>In the heart of bustling cities, there exists an expansive group that is often overlooked and forgotten: street children. These young souls, braving the harsh realities of life on the streets, face an uphill battle against not only poverty and neglect but also a lack of access to proper healthcare. The need to protect underprivileged children and provide them with comprehensive healthcare support is paramount, as it directly impacts their chances of having a healthy, happy childhood and a promising future.</p>



<p>Imagine a childhood spent without the warmth of a secure home, without proper nourishment, and without the protection of basic medical care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> are exposed to numerous health risks, from malnutrition and respiratory infections to injuries sustained on the unforgiving streets. The absence of timely medical attention exacerbates their vulnerability, jeopardising their overall well-being. By extending proper healthcare to these children, we ensure not only their physical health but also their mental and emotional resilience.</p>



<p>A healthy childhood
is the foundation upon which a promising future is built. Adequate healthcare
plays an indispensable role in nurturing the potential of at-risk children,
enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and adversity. When these children
receive regular medical check-ups, vaccinations, and treatments, they are
better equipped to focus on their education and personal growth. By addressing
their health needs, we pave the way for a brighter tomorrow where these
children can contribute positively to society.</p>



<p>Moreover, providing
healthcare support to underserved children sends a powerful messageâ€”that they
matter. When we invest in their well-being, we communicate their worth and
dignity as individuals. This fosters a sense of belonging and instills in them
the confidence to dream big. A healthy childhood brings with it a sense of
normalcy, offering these children a chance to experience the joys and wonders that
every child deserves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a beacon of hope, is dedicated to uplifting street and working children. With unwavering commitment, they provide essential medical aid, nurturing these young lives towards brighter futures. By offering healthcare and resources, SBT ensures that vulnerable children receive the care they deserve. Your support can change lives, offering these children a chance for better health and opportunities. Let&#8217;s come together to create lasting change. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for Street children</a> and become a part of SBT&#8217;s inspiring journey.</p>

<p>Street children in India face a multitude of challenges, including poor living conditions, limited access to education, and inadequate healthcare. Providing quality medical care for these vulnerable children is not just a basic human right; it is also crucial for their overall well-being and future prospects.</p>



<p>Many of the at-risk children lack access to basic medical
aid such as vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care.
This is due to a variety of factors, including poverty, social exclusion, and
discrimination. Without access to proper medical support, street children are
more likely to suffer from serious illnesses and injuries, and their physical
and mental development can be affected.</p>



<p>In addition to physical healthcare, it is also important
to address the mental health of street children. These children often face
traumatic experiences such as abuse, neglect, and violence. The stress and
anxiety associated with living on the streets can also take a toll on their
mental health. However, mental health issues are often overlooked, with little
attention paid to the psychological needs of street children. This can have
serious long-term consequences, including a higher risk of developing mental
health disorders and difficulties in social and emotional development.</p>



<p>To address these issues, it is crucial to provide quality
medical support that is accessible and culturally sensitive. Healthcare
providers should be trained to understand the unique needs of street children
and provide care that is tailored to their specific circumstances. This
includes addressing the mental health needs of street children and providing
appropriate counselling and support.</p>



<p>One way to improve access to <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach-and-community-projects.php">medical aid for street children</a> is through mobile clinics. These clinics can travel to areas where street children congregate, such as railway stations, bus stops, and parks. They can provide basic healthcare services, including vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care. Mobile clinics can also provide mental health support and counselling, which is crucial for addressing the mental health needs of street children.</p>



<p>Another way to address the healthcare needs of street
children is through partnerships between healthcare providers and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that work with street children. These
partnerships can provide a more comprehensive approach to healthcare,
addressing both physical and mental health needs. NGOs can also provide a safe
space for street children to access healthcare without fear of discrimination
or stigma.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust is one suchÂ <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Â </a></strong>that provides varied resources of paramount importance to the welfare of street and working children in India. SBT ensures it provides a safe and protective environment for these children, who face painful and horrific experiences on the streets that are often unspeakable. YourÂ <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation in India</a>Â can help SBT provide healthcare aid that is accessible, culturally sensitive, and addresses their unique needs. Support now!</p>

<p>In recent years, the number of people in India who suffer from depression, anxiety, and other related mental illnesses has increased significantly. In the case of children living on the streets of India, the condition has only worsened, with dangerous surroundings, deteriorating habits, and little or no resources to bank upon. Children who live on the streets have fewer chances for emotional and physical well-being. They are denied the two fundamental emotions for any childâ€”care and love.</p>



<p>Food, shelter, education, basic medical resources etc. are every childâ€™s basic rights, but they still do not have access to these, let alone guidance to improve their mental health. Besides tangible aids, underprivileged children require collective efforts and essential tools, along with healthcare professionals, to work on their mental health. At such an impressionable age, underprivileged children live in such difficult environments. It is time to pay attention to their overall welfare to help them build their personalities and strive for a positive and productive future.</p>



<p>Only a small number of NGOs are genuinely striving to rescue street children and work with them towards rehabilitation in all ways possible. The majority of these cases involve violence, sexual assault, child labour, trafficking etc. This is why it is important to rescue these children and provide them with a secure home complete with all the necessary comforts.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi-NCR</a>, has been working to support street children for over 30 years. The NGO is strategically placed in New Delhi and works around the clock to protect children by rescuing and rehabilitating them and offering them Childrenâ€™s Homes where they are placed to eventually attend school and receive the finest care that all children deserve.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for children</a>&nbsp;to help them live better lives than the ones on the streets. You can also avail of an&nbsp;income tax exemption&nbsp;under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act to help create a promising future for Indiaâ€™s children. Support Salaam Baalak Trustâ€™s mental health programmes now!</p>

<p>Children on the streets have a tough time living a life of distress and deprivation. They are also going through a lot of uncertainty and more often than not, that ends up affecting their mental well-being. This is because street life can be extremely distressing to a childâ€™s impressionable mind.</p>



<p>This is the age when children need to be well looked after. Instead, they have to live without any basic necessities and make several life choices on a daily basis. These integral resources include a safe shelter, quality healthcare services, hot and nutritious meals, regular education etc. But the reality is far from this, as we know. Children have to fend for themselves and typically, they end up getting stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty, illiteracy, child labour, and other forms of exploitation etc.</p>



<p>Mental health is an essential topic in the case of underprivileged children and must be addressed. There are many areas of concern when it comes to theÂ <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health of street children</a>. They may go through depression, substance abuse, anxiety, sleeplessness etc. After all, surviving on your own from a tender age can be a severely disturbing issue for a child. This is why regular medical check-ups must be conducted to ensure no mental health issue is overlooked as that may worsen the situation.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children also require proper medical support and Salaam Baalak Trust has been working relentlessly to rescue andÂ <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/restoration.php">rehabilitate street children</a>. The non-profit organisation also ensures that there are proper records of childrenâ€™s medical history of diseases, check-ups and treatments to ensure they receive the best of medical support. Regular health camps are also conducted for the children to spread awareness on the importance of good health and ensure that childrenâ€™s health is not neglected anymore.</p>



<p>10th October
is commemorated as World Mental Health Day. You can generously donate for
children and ensure they are provided with proper medical support, safety and
protection, to ensure they have a positive and promising future. Join hands
with Salaam Balaak Trust and gift children a better childhood!</p>

<p>Mental health is getting more attention in the mainstream media in recent years â€“ a welcome change as it signals that more people are becoming aware of the causes and impact of mental health. Innumerable people suffer silently and fight on their own, without any professional help or the support of their family and/or friends.</p>



<p>The situation is even worse for street children in India, one of
the most vulnerable groups that are often given little or no attention.
Children living on the streets and working children (engaged in child labour)
live in an environment that is not conducive for their growth.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Street children (opens in a new tab)">Street children</a>Â live in high-stress surroundings, constantly looking for basic utilities like food, shelter, clothing, and even a support system to depend on. Many of the rescued street children are known to experience anxiety, sleeplessness, anger and trust issues, and even end up having dependency issues due to substance abuse. Many children face domestic abuse at home and run away from their homes to search for a better environment while other children face varied types of abuse (mental, physical, emotional) on the streets â€“ all of these leave a deep and long-lasting impact on the psyche that must be addressed and resolved. Children are quite impressionable during their formative years and require gentle and protective mentors around them to guide them through these early phases.</p>



<p>To help children have a hopeful and positive future, Salaam
Baalak Trust, one of the top NGOs in India, rescues and rehabilitates children
at their centres. They are provided with immense support, care, and essential
resources (medical facilities, access to extra-curricular activities etc) to
help them build a prosperous future. Several children who get lost or are
separated from their families are also reconnected if possible, and get a
second chance to a happier childhood.</p>



<p>You
can support the efforts of Salaam Baalak Trust and help improve the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health
of street children</a>. Donate for childrenâ€™s overall development to ensure
their well-being. Generously contribute to Salaam Baalak Trust right away!</p>

<p>Street children live in extremely vulnerable environments. Their daily life is full of unplanned circumstances and a lot of struggle. They have to learn to fend for themselves and hustle daily to make ends meet somehow, that too, without any adult supervision. The typical method that is followed to live such a life is to take one day at a time and function according to a particular dayâ€™s battles.</p>



<p>When it comes to financial support,
street and working children can be found working odd jobs that involve
extremely low-paid work like selling merchandise (cheap goods) or chores like
shining shoes etc. Many children can also be found working at restaurants (<em>dhabas&nbsp;</em>on
highways etc) or smaller shops to have an inflow of basic cash. These types of
jobs are not very reliable and that is why children can be found hopping from
one form of employment to another.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many children on the
streets end up joining gangs and engage in criminal activities. Typically, it
starts with pickpocketing etc and soon aggravates into selling drugs,
prostitution, and other types of violent activities. The need for survival is
the main driving force that blurs the line of morality and continues to pull
them away from an honest living.</p>



<p>Health and nutrition is another area
where street children suffer. Medical support is integral for children during
their formative years. There is a major lack of resources that they must be
able to access when they fall ill or even go through mental health issues.
Unfortunately, for many people,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health
concerning street children</a>&nbsp;is a lesser-known concept but it
needs to be given more importance. Spreading awareness regarding the need for
counselling etc, especially for children living in harsh and extreme
conditions, is required urgently.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi, a
well-known NGO, ensures that several street children are rescued and
rehabilitated; in many cases, they are reunited with their families as well.
You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for the education
of children</a>, and also ensure that they are provided with a safe
shelter, healthcare facilities, regular counselling, vocational training etc.
So wait no more and join hands with SBT to make a real difference in the lives
of street children. Donate to SBT now!</p>

<p>In the face of abandonment and abuse early in life, millions of children are found living on the streets of India every year. In various nooks and corners of the country, homeless children are desperately hunting for stability and security, in terms of food, shelter and clothing. Most children do not understand that besides these essentials, other integral components required in their lives are education, healthcare and access to other extra-curricular activities to enhance their minds as well as protect their bodies. But why would children be aware of this &#8211; it is the job of adults to provide such resources for children to cash upon.</p>
<p><strong><b>Finding a Solution<br />
</b></strong>We all come across children who are beggars, hawkers, working at small shops, or even caught stealing and other such crimes. As bystanders, are we really participating in the solution to this deep-rooted problem that the society is suffering from. Children are meant to be the future of the country and yet, they are struggling to find their next meal, every day.</p>
<p>Over 30 years ago, Salaam Baalak Trust came up with a solution. A model that changed the lives of thousands of children in the country. SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/projects.php"><u>rescues abandoned children</u></a>Â to provide them with a safe and sensitive environment that focuses on their growth.</p>
<p>Mainly, it works towards removing the walls of judgement towards disadvantaged children in society. Among other programs, SBT also provides full time and short-stay facilities for homeless children, a much-needed support system that continues to save lives of many children.</p>
<p><strong><b>Take a Step<br />
</b></strong>Besides educational aids, SBT believes in giving children a platform to showcase their artistic side. Studies also show that children from abused backgrounds stabilise faster with the support of performing arts and other creative mediums, like dance, theatre, painting etc. The <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php"><u>mental health of street children</u></a>Â begins to heal eventually.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s not turn a blind eye, and letâ€™s definitely not sit idle while children suffer from loneliness and lack of basic amenities. Start by becoming an ambassador of goodness, via time, skills or monetary support. Visit Salaam Baalak Trustâ€™s social media platforms to keep yourself updated, and join the revolution.</p>
