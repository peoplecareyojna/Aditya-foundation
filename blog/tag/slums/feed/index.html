<p>National Education Day is an occasion that commemorates the need for all children to be educated. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">education for street children</a> is still not a reality in most parts of India. The number of children living on the streets and working hard to survive has been steadily rising. Education is not even on their radar amidst the struggle to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Innumerable underprivileged children wind up on the streets for a variety of reasons. Many of them travel to Delhi from their impoverished backgrounds in search of chances and a better life. Some run away from their homes due to abusive and careless guardians, while others have been reported to be cut off from their relatives and are unable to contact them again. The suffering of these children as they struggle on the unpredictable streets of India is a wake-up call for the entire nation.</p>



<p>Presently, children can be seen doing varied random activities on the streets, be it selling knick-knacks at traffic signals, begging, picking up trash, or worse, engaging in illegal activities. This is not the life fit for anyone &#8211; definitely not for children.</p>



<p>A Tough Life<br>The problems that Delhi&#8217;s street children face are numerous. Children not only endure a rough life that is frequently dangerous and without shelter, but they also have to deal with violence and brutality. Adults abuse young children, compel them to work, beg, and commit crimes. They are also verbally, physically, and emotionally abused. There have been reports of abuse and violence against more than half of the population of street children, and so much of it still goes unreported. The majority of children lack ID cards or other documents that would allow them to participate in government programmes that supply essentials to minors. The world&#8217;s greatest concentration of street children is thought to be in India.</p>



<p>Protection and Rehabilitation<br>Numerous NGOs have been extending support in many forms to support street children. One such NGO that has dedicated years of effort to the well-being of India&#8217;s street children is Salaam Baalak Trust. SBT offers food, clothing, healthcare, education, and most importantly, love and care. This National Education Day, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for children&#8217;s education</a> to help give them a promising future, one that enables them to pursue their dreams and eventually have a job to pay their bills. Let’s give a better life to them!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/vicky_33_017.jpg" alt="Street Children" class="wp-image-197"/></figure>



<p>There millions of children living on the streets of India. This is a harsh reality that must be improved for the betterment of the youth. The tumultuous surroundings of street children are daunting and unpredictable. Children are surrounded by adversity and shortage of all resources. Be it a safe shelter, basic education, medical facilities, or mentoring, street children do not have access to any of these essential tools to lead a happy, healthy, and productive childhood. Instead, the dark underbelly of India’s streets offers negative experiences like abuse, exploitation, violence, and depravity.</p>



<p>Street children run away from their homes due to varied reasons
revolving around discouraging circumstances but they end up in even worse
situations. Many children end up participating in child labour to survive on
the streets alone. The hours are long and the wages are the bare minimum,
besides the toll it takes on their mental and physical well-being. Several
hazardous conditions can also be found in factories where children are employed
which may have immediate as well as a long-term negative effect on them. Many
underprivileged children work as domestic help too, and what makes it worse is
that it is socially acceptable in many homes.</p>



<p>In an effort to survive on the rough streets, many children end
up engaging in illegal activities which only worsen their condition. Many
children take hard drugs too and the dependency on such chemicals makes them even
more susceptible to “do whatever it takes” for the next hit. Several children
on the streets are prone to drug abuse which is rather unfortunate as it
steadily dwindles their opportunities of a brighter and healthier future.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">Rescuing street children </a>is integral as they are the future of India. Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed non-profit organisation that provides a sensitive and caring environment for street and working children. The efforts of SBT help provide a platform for children to realize their full potential, offer them their right to a safe and secure space, and give access to education, health and nutrition. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong> </strong>to help make a difference in their lives and improve their chances of a prosperous future.</p>

<p>We all know about the existence of street children in India. Their presence is apparent to everyone yet most of us to choose to ignore them. It is a deplorable state of affairs to see how children, who require constant and an abundance of support, are deprived of basic resources and mentorship. They roam around the streets to fend for themselves. They may even be seen working odd jobs at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>, rag-picking at railway stations, shoe cleaning in busy streets, or even begging at temples and bus stands etc.</p>



<p>Many people try to&nbsp;rescue street children,&nbsp;temporarily, by giving them some money or a meal to eat. This is an act of kindness but one that is hardly part of the solution. Some people even think that employing poor children at their homes to do the domestic chores will help, when in fact, it is an act of engaging in child labour. This contributes to more harm than good and affects the psychological and physical well-being of the child.&nbsp;It is to be noted that no child must ever engage in any sort of labour. These impressionable years require for children to study, play with other children of their age group, participate in extra-curricular activities, watch informative visual content etc. Instead, rescuing&nbsp;abandoned street children&nbsp;becomes an even more distant dream when the plight of their street life is observed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many individuals, government agencies and non-profit organizations in India that are working hard to improve the struggles of street children and help provide them with short-term and/or long-term support. One of the NGOs that is known to offer generous support and a commendable platform to underprivileged children is Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi. This non-profit has been working in the respective field for more than 30 years and has protected many children by placing them in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter for street children</a>. The children are offered nutritious meals, a safe shelter, nurturing guardians, and playmates of their age for them to uplift the quality of their life. You can also help Salaam Baalak Trust in their endeavour to empower street children and ensure that they lead happier and healthier lives. So wait no more and join in to help more children lead a life without hardships and sufferings. Donate now!</p>

<p>Street children live in extremely vulnerable environments. Their daily life is full of unplanned circumstances and a lot of struggle. They have to learn to fend for themselves and hustle daily to make ends meet somehow, that too, without any adult supervision. The typical method that is followed to live such a life is to take one day at a time and function according to a particular day’s battles.</p>



<p>When it comes to financial support,
street and working children can be found working odd jobs that involve
extremely low-paid work like selling merchandise (cheap goods) or chores like
shining shoes etc. Many children can also be found working at restaurants (<em>dhabas&nbsp;</em>on
highways etc) or smaller shops to have an inflow of basic cash. These types of
jobs are not very reliable and that is why children can be found hopping from
one form of employment to another.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many children on the
streets end up joining gangs and engage in criminal activities. Typically, it
starts with pickpocketing etc and soon aggravates into selling drugs,
prostitution, and other types of violent activities. The need for survival is
the main driving force that blurs the line of morality and continues to pull
them away from an honest living.</p>



<p>Health and nutrition is another area
where street children suffer. Medical support is integral for children during
their formative years. There is a major lack of resources that they must be
able to access when they fall ill or even go through mental health issues.
Unfortunately, for many people,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health
concerning street children</a>&nbsp;is a lesser-known concept but it
needs to be given more importance. Spreading awareness regarding the need for
counselling etc, especially for children living in harsh and extreme
conditions, is required urgently.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi, a
well-known NGO, ensures that several street children are rescued and
rehabilitated; in many cases, they are reunited with their families as well.
You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for the education
of children</a>, and also ensure that they are provided with a safe
shelter, healthcare facilities, regular counselling, vocational training etc.
So wait no more and join hands with SBT to make a real difference in the lives
of street children. Donate to SBT now!</p>

<p>Street children often take up innumerable jobs to make ends meet. In order to survive in the harsh conditions of the streets, children ought to fend for themselves, to be able to provide bare minimum utilities for themselves, like food, clothing, shelter. Even though most children make-do with the basics, or often barely so, they engage in odd jobs to survive on the streets. Street children face a lot many hurdles to work for a basic wage &#8211; they can often take everyday-odd jobs or work regularly at a place that is quite hazardous to them &#8211; mentally, physically, and even emotionally. Following are some of the jobs that working children engage in for basic survival.</p>



<p>Laborers<br>Children work in factories that are horribly unsafe, unhealthy and underpaid. From working in factories that moves coal and makes crackers to garment warehouses and restaurants, children can be seen working for long hours and in extreme weather conditions. They constantly experience burnout.</p>



<p>Rag-Picking<br>This is a common sight in India &#8211; children can be seen with gunny bags that help them carry any number of things &#8211; from plastic bottles to paper and tin. Anything that can be recycled or even used at their temporary place of stay is picked up by these children. They can also be found near dustbins and other dumping grounds picking material. </p>



<p>Odd Jobs<br>Many children are involved in occupations that are temporary and that offer day-to-day earnings. From messenger-boys to cleaners, peddlers and even petty-hawkers, children are often involved in irregular tasks.</p>



<p>Porters<br>One may often come across street children working at wholesale markets, railway stations, bus stands, and even godowns. Children carry varied weights of material and have to often pull or push them to short or even long distances. </p>



<p>If you have come across <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> carrying out any of the above tasks, or even know about how children in India are living in such dire circumstances, then take the plunge to help Salaam Baalak Trust. The non-profit organization works for street and working children to empower them with education, safe shelter and performing arts. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a> right away.</p>

<p>In the face of abandonment and abuse early in life, millions of children are found living on the streets of India every year. In various nooks and corners of the country, homeless children are desperately hunting for stability and security, in terms of food, shelter and clothing. Most children do not understand that besides these essentials, other integral components required in their lives are education, healthcare and access to other extra-curricular activities to enhance their minds as well as protect their bodies. But why would children be aware of this &#8211; it is the job of adults to provide such resources for children to cash upon.</p>
<p><strong><b>Finding a Solution<br />
</b></strong>We all come across children who are beggars, hawkers, working at small shops, or even caught stealing and other such crimes. As bystanders, are we really participating in the solution to this deep-rooted problem that the society is suffering from. Children are meant to be the future of the country and yet, they are struggling to find their next meal, every day.</p>
<p>Over 30 years ago, Salaam Baalak Trust came up with a solution. A model that changed the lives of thousands of children in the country. SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/projects.php"><u>rescues abandoned children</u></a> to provide them with a safe and sensitive environment that focuses on their growth.</p>
<p>Mainly, it works towards removing the walls of judgement towards disadvantaged children in society. Among other programs, SBT also provides full time and short-stay facilities for homeless children, a much-needed support system that continues to save lives of many children.</p>
<p><strong><b>Take a Step<br />
</b></strong>Besides educational aids, SBT believes in giving children a platform to showcase their artistic side. Studies also show that children from abused backgrounds stabilise faster with the support of performing arts and other creative mediums, like dance, theatre, painting etc. The <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php"><u>mental health of street children</u></a> begins to heal eventually.</p>
<p>Let’s not turn a blind eye, and let’s definitely not sit idle while children suffer from loneliness and lack of basic amenities. Start by becoming an ambassador of goodness, via time, skills or monetary support. Visit Salaam Baalak Trust’s social media platforms to keep yourself updated, and join the revolution.</p>
