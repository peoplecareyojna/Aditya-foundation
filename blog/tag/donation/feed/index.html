<p>Street children face an overwhelming struggle where they have to navigate a world filled with dangers and uncertainties. For these vulnerable children, who are constantly at risk, a safe shelter isn&#8217;t just a physical space; it represents a sanctuary where their basic needs are met and where they find refuge from the harsh realities of life on the streets. Providing secure shelters equipped with integral resources and aid is imperative to protecting and nurturing these children.</p>



<p>These shelters must offer more
than just a roof overhead. They should serve as holistic havens, providing
access to education, healthcare, psychological support, and life skills
training. Education stands as a beacon of hope, empowering these children with
the knowledge and skills necessary for a better future. Integrating healthcare
facilities ensures their physical well-being, addressing ailments resulting
from their impoverished living conditions and often risky lifestyles.</p>



<p>Moreover, psychological support
is crucial, as many <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street
children in India</a> have experienced trauma or abuse and need guidance to
heal and thrive. Equipping them with life skills like vocational training or
basic financial literacy fosters their independence, allowing them to break
free from the cycle of poverty.</p>



<p>Integral to these shelters is a
nurturing environment where caretakers offer mentorship, guidance, and
emotional support. Creating a sense of community and belonging helps rebuild
the shattered trust and confidence of these children, giving them a sense of
purpose and self-worth.</p>



<p>Collaboration between
governments, NGOs, and communities is paramount in establishing and maintaining
such shelters. Adequate funding, resources, and trained staff are essential for
their sustainability. Raising awareness about the plight of street children and
garnering support from society can drive initiatives aimed at providing safe
shelters.</p>



<p>By offering these children a safe
shelter along with essential resources, we not only protect them from the
difficulties of the streets but also invest in shaping a brighter future. It&#8217;s
the collective responsibility of every nation and society to ensure that every
child, regardless of their circumstances, is granted the opportunity to grow up
in a secure and nurturing environment, fostering their potential and
contributing positively to society.

Salaam Baalak Trust is dedicated to protecting
and supporting street children in India, providing safe shelters, education,
and healthcare resources. Your support can transform lives, offering these
vulnerable children a chance at a brighter future. Donate today to Salaam
Baalak Trust and help <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">educate
street children</a>, offering them a secure haven and essential resources they
need to thrive.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Healthcare-of-Street-Children.jpg" alt="Healthcare of Street Children" class="wp-image-379" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Healthcare-of-Street-Children.jpg 950w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Healthcare-of-Street-Children-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Healthcare-of-Street-Children-768x525.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></figure>



<p>In a world where the marginalised are deprived of their basic rights, it falls upon the privileged communities to extend a helping hand to at-risk groups and uplift their current circumstances. Among these vulnerable groups, children bear the brunt of dire conditions on the streets, subjecting them to physical, mental, and emotional hardships. Thus, it is imperative to address their medical needs and provide them with the necessary support.</p>



<p>Street children
endure unimaginable hardships, lacking access to basic necessities, healthcare,
and protection. They face numerous hazards, including malnutrition, abuse,
exploitation, and poor living conditions, which jeopardise their well-being and
future prospects. Urgent action is needed to address their medical needs and
offer them a lifeline.</p>



<p>There are many
government initiatives, individuals, and the efforts of dedicated organisations
that are creating a safer and healthier environment for street and working
children. Through medical camps, outreach programmes, and collaborations with
healthcare professionals, these organisations aim to provide essential medical
attention to these children. By focusing on multifaceted approaches, they seek
to meet the urgent medical requirements of these vulnerable children.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust,
a trusted <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi,</a> works for the welfare of street and working children in
India. The transformative organisation provides essential services like
healthcare, education, and shelter to underprivileged children. SBT empowers
them by ensuring they live a life of hope, dignity, and a chance at a
prosperous life. Its impact resonates through transformed lives, reduced
vulnerability, and a more inclusive society that cherishes and nurtures its
future generations.</p>



<p>We have to pave the
way for a brighter future by supporting Salaam Baalak Trust&#8217;s noble efforts to
provide medical aid to street and working children. Your contribution will help
create a more promising and inclusive society where every child&#8217;s health and well-being
are prioritised. Join SBT in their unwavering commitment to safeguard the lives
of these precious children by donating today. You can make a generous <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online

<p>Children in our country hold the key to a developed country with a bright future. However, not all of them receive the treatment they merit. Unfortunately, our country&#8217;s street children suffer the most from the economic downturn, shoddy infrastructure, and crumbling system. To ensure that they develop into better citizens of the country, it is crucial to give them all of your attention and goodness. <br><br>Innumerable children who end up on the streets have actually run away from home. They flee because they frequently strive to avoid domestic abuse and even early marriages. When they move to a new city or area, they frequently accept low-paying employment and often resort to begging. These children experience physical, mental, and even sexual abuse in such situations. Therefore, it is crucial to protect them from such horrors.&nbsp;<br><br>Numerous NGOs are working to provide street children with the best lives they can have – but it is a herculean task that requires all the support possible, and then some. Salaam Baalak Trust is one of the most respected and trusted organisations, dedicated to helping street children. The NGO, based in New Delhi, has been fervently carrying out child-centric programmes to help make a real difference in the lives of street and working children. SBT provides them with education, clothing, healthcare, and shelter. Most importantly, the non-profit organisation provides love, care, and protection – something they have almost never experienced. &nbsp;The improvement in children&#8217;s life is the major goal – for a wholesome childhood and a promising future. </p>



<p>SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues street children</a>&nbsp;and improves their quality of life through collective and constant efforts. And you can also help by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and contribute towards their well-being. In addition to a generous contribution, you can volunteer at SBT too. This may include activities like Yoga, dance, music, and more. Volunteers from India and the world look forward to their time volunteering at SBT and going back home with priceless experiences. Donate for the welfare of street children and ensure they are protected from the harsh and unforgiving streets of India. Support now!</p>

<p>In India, several children live on the streets. These children are not raised by anyone, rather they take care of themselves in every way possible. This is why disadvantaged children frequently work odd jobs or partake in illicit activities to support themselves. They struggle to find the minimal necessities, such as food, clothing, meals, and shelter, to survive the difficulties that engulf them. Their surroundings are unpredictable and dark. The underbelly of Delhi, in particular, is no place for young children and yet there are millions of underprivileged children who try every day to somehow survive those overwhelming streets. </p>



<p><a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a>&nbsp;engage in employment throughout those formative years as daily wagers to obtain basic resources. Although it has an impact on their mental, physical, and even emotional health, children persevere and work hard to earn minimum wages to survive on their own on the unforgiving streets.</p>



<p>A major amount of labour force constitutes children. For factory owners, this is the most cost-effective option because children are an illegal workforce and will labour for lesser money and a lot of hard work. Sadly, they are expected to work long hours in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in factories. Children can be found working in varied places, including local restaurants, vendor shops, and companies that produce crackers, clothes, coal, etc. Car cleaners, warehouse employees, porters at train stations and bus stops, messenger boys, and other odd jobs are just a few examples where children can be seen working. Another self-employed activity that frequently involves street children is rag picking. Children gather these arbitrary goods, such as plastic bottles, paper, and tin, which they can sell to make some basic money for food or any other essential resource. Children gather materials to sell for recycling from dustbins and other dumping areas nearby, also known as ragpickers. And yet, no one speaks up for them or protects them.</p>



<p>Street and working children are in desperate need of assistance. A reputable non-profit organisation in India, Salaam Baalak Trust, works with children in need to uplift and empower them through education, healthcare facilities, a safe shelter, performing arts programmes, mental health support etc. Your contribution can significantly improve the lives of children living on the streets.&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a>&nbsp;right away and help Salaam Baalak Trust make a real difference!</p>

<p><a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a>&nbsp;have been struggling for most of their childhood to make ends meet. It is an excruciating task to survive on the harsh streets, also known as the underbelly that is not talked about. Many day-to-day atrocities take place that severely affects children in particular. After all, their impressionable minds and developing bodies are mostly unable to bear the pressures of all the changes and dangers that they face daily.</p>



<p>Safety in many unforeseeable situations and protection from varied dangerous characters is a constant struggle. Even then, children are forced to look after themselves – without having any access to their basic rights of regular education, proper meals, healthcare facilities etc. Many street children work during these impressionable years – they can be found working long and tedious hours at the local <em>dhabas</em>, as domestic help, young girls and boys begging at traffic signals, or becoming a helper to the vegetable seller. Other children can be found rag-picking, and some end up engaging in violence, theft, and even human trafficking – either by force or due to the unfortunate turn of fate.</p>



<p>Children in need must be able to go to school and participate in varied artistic and physical activities to hone their personalities. They must be given the opportunity to shine and flourish through their skills and preferences in life. But the lack of adult supervision and little or no access to resources charts a different life trajectory – one that suppresses them and deteriorates their life. Many children also end up facing mental health issues as most children on the streets face mental, physical, and psychological trauma – that carries out for many years ahead.</p>



<p>It is time we give a real chance to millions of children on the streets to ensure they have a more fulfilling, wholesome, positive, and prosperous future. An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation in India</a>&nbsp;to a trusted and respected non-profit organization like Salaam Baalak Trust can make quite a difference to these children. So wait no more and donate to gift a promising future to street children &#8211; one that they truly deserve. You can also spread the word in your community and circle of friends and family about SBT’s programs. Come together and support these children who have been forgotten by society.

<p>Republic Day is commemorated on 26th January. This is an integral occasion for all Indians as it is the day when the nation marched towards democracy and the Declaration of Indian Independence was issued. The country has had many milestones since then and varied developments have been quite fruitful in the global context. The children of India who live on the streets still have a long way to go. Unfortunately, they continue to live a life of deprivation where they long for safety and protection.</p>



<p>India is a strong nation with many possibilities and opportunities extended to its people across the globe. Underprivileged children, however, have a hard time living without basic resources. They are deprived of all basic resources, including shelter, food, education etc. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> have a hard time living in unpredictable and overwhelming environments that affect them in more ways than one – physically as well as psychologically.Many children end up working at varied places to find odd jobs, thus engaging in child labour. Child abuse is another awful practice that several children become a part of – be it due to prostitution, gangs and other harmful practices.</p>



<p>It is time
children receive love and care, as well as access to healthcare resources etc
to be able to have a healthy and productive childhood. Children must be able to
play with other children, experience joy and jubilation, and have a prosperous
future, devoid of negativity and hostility.</p>



<p>This
Republic Day, let’s pledge to be more forthcoming towards the welfare of street
children. They must also be seen, heard and welcomed as an integral part of
society. Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most respected and trusted non-profit
organisations in India, has been working diligently towards the betterment of
street and working children. SBT has set up many Children’s Homes to ensure
children receive resources that help them in learning and growing properly.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for the children</a> of India and protect their future. After all, a country’s growth is directly related to the opportunities and resources its children have. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s programs and extend better and wholesome living conditions for children. Donate now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-1024x536.jpg" alt="Diwali Celebration at SBT" class="wp-image-252" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Diwali is here &#8211; the wonderful festival of lights that brings prosperity and joy into our lives. But this is not the case for street children. Millions of children go to work every day to earn daily wages. This is their reality of street children and the reason behind their deteriorating health &#8211; mental, physical and emotional. Countless children from all walks of life in India spend their childhood working hard to earn any basic wages to have access to some resources to survive. Instead of enjoying the joys of these early growth periods, they work long hours and are involved in tedious chores. Child labour has become the norm for most people where they don&#8217;t bat an eye when children beg on the streets or work at a roadside stall or as domestic help etc. Children can even be seen washing dishes behind the restaurant, sitting at paan shops, or shining shoes on many busy streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason for their participation in multiple areas of work is because they have no other option to survive. Most underprivileged children are orphans and live in abject poverty. Many are also abandoned while others work to help contribute to their family’s minimum income. Many children run away from home; these street children do not have any guardians or other resources to guide them on the right path to a healthy childhood.</p>



<p>There are many dangerous places such as different types of factories etc where children can be found working in extreme heat or bitter cold. They participate in dangerous activities to earn less than the minimum wage, even at the expense of their health. Children can be seen working at factories that produce clothing, crackers, tobacco, biscuits, etc, and many other unstructured businesses that employ young children to work for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Child labour keeps children away from playing with other children which is extremely harmful to a child during their impressionable years. This greatly affects their psychological and social development. Through proper playtime activities, children learn to cultivate friendship and nurture positive connections with others which helps them become confident, compassionate and caring people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the true essence of Diwali, an auspicious occasion, you can donate to Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has been working for the welfare of street children for over 30 years. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">Donate for children&#8217;s medical aid</a> and help SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescue abandoned children</a>.

<p>Across the country, many children face daily struggles due to the harsh life on the streets. Millions of children in India are experiencing abuse, exploitation, hunger, and exclusion. The basic rights of children are also not extended to them – this includes the right to safety and protection, right to clean water, right to regular and healthy meals, right education, right to safe shelter, and the right to access to healthcare facilities.</p>



<p>The rights of children cannot be ignored and to ensure the same,
April 12th is marked as International Day for Street Children. This day is
commemorated to ensure that the condition of street children is brought to the
forefront and their plight is given a platform to address. It is high time
underprivileged children have a collective support system to help them step out
of the vicious cycle. The patterns of abuse, exploitation, illiteracy, and
poverty lead to many other long-term repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fundamental and constructive change is the need of the hour as
several children can still be seen begging at traffic signals, engaging in
labour work and other menial jobs to make ends meet somehow, or becoming a
ragpicker. Be it as domestic help or joining street gangs, children do anything
to survive as there is no mentoring or support system in place to guide them
through their impressionable years.</p>



<p>The International Day of Street Children is important as it helps raise much-needed awareness on the plight of the street and working children who have been discriminated against for far too long. This is where Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s reputed non-profit organisation, has been diligently working on for more than 30 years. SBT provides all of the integral resources for street and working children and also <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues abandoned children</a>. SBT offers full care and protection to the children and ensures that they have access to health and nutrition, mental health, and quality education. The children are placed in various Children’s Homes and also enrolled in vocational training programs to help them build their personalities and expand their minds. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php"> </a></strong>and celebrate the true spirit of International Day for Street Children.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/donate-for-street-children.jpg" alt="street children in India" class="wp-image-202"/></figure>



<p>Street children are not a rare sight in India. They are all around us and unfortunately, it has become normal to see them and not pay heed to their existence on the streets. Children are the future of every country as they lead the nation forward towards newer developments and heights of success. But millions of children in India are living on the streets and looking after themselves however they best can.</p>



<p>All children require necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. There are other integral resources too that help contributes to their development like healthcare facilities, participation in extra-curricular activities etc. Having responsible and caring adults around also helps provide them with a support system that is much-required during the initial impressionable years of children. The streets are harsh and deprived of such resources that further deteriorate their living conditions. Living in such extreme vulnerable conditions, that too, at such a young age, can be traumatising and that is why many children on the streets resort to drug abuse, violence etc.</p>



<p>The
fundamental requirement in the case of street children is the understanding of
their basic rights and provide them with those like basic education. Attending
school and receiving a quality education is essential for underprivileged
children. It not only helps them move past the vicious cycle of poverty and get
stable jobs in the future but also helps them grow up to be responsible and
driven individuals who strive for success.</p>



<p>This is where Salaam Baalak Trust comes into the picture as the well-known and reputed non-profit organisation has been working for the welfare of street children. SBT, based out of Delhi in India, focuses on <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescuing street children</a><strong> </strong>and help them rehabilitate and readjust in society. Many children are also helped in reuniting them with their families. Several children get separated from their families and SBT helps them find their homes.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a> and help them have a real chance at a prosperous future. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s efforts to ensure more children have access to basic education, medical support, healthy meals etc. Donate now to make a difference!</p>

<p>20th November is celebrated as World Children’s Day. This day reminds us to protect and encourage children to strive for a prosperous future. It also urges people to help create environments for children where they can grow, feel safe, and nurture their dreams.</p>



<p>There is also a side of reality that is rather grim as a large number of children who live on the streets of India. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a> are a major part of the society that survives on less than basic resources, be it food, shelter, clothing, medical facilities etc. Street children can be found on the streets and in many vacant alleys. They can also be seen at railway stations, bus stands, or traffic signals. Many street children are beggars while others either loiter around, engage in illegal activities, and/or participate in child labour.</p>



<p>Many
children work in factories, local stalls or shops, and are even employed as
domestic help. Underprivileged children strive to get by (survive) daily and
their main concern is to earn money however they possibly can. Such is the
exhausting and vulnerable life of a street and working child in India. But this
is far from what a child deserves, especially during their formative years. This
impressionable age bracket demands that a child lives in a surrounding that
contributes to their growth, and not worry about how and when their next meal
will come.</p>



<p>To help thousands of vulnerable children, Salaam Baalak Trust, a well-known nonprofit organization in India, has been working relentlessly for decades to improve their condition. Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi rescues and rehabilitates children. SBT also runs shelter homes for girls and boys where they are provided with a safe shelter, regular and nutritious meals, clothing, and timely health check-ups. Most importantly, the NGO ensures that all children receive regular education to ensure they have a brighter future. There are also many extra-curricular activities that the children can participate in which helps in an overall improvement in the attitude, personality, and lifestyle of the children.<br>This World Children’s Day, support SBT’s programs by <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>.
