<p>Street children are those who are forced to live on the streets due to poverty, neglect, or abuse. These children are exposed to a wide range of dangers, such as violence, sexual abuse, and substance abuse. To ensure their safety and well-being, it is essential to provide them with a safe shelter.</p>



<p>The plight of street
children is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. These children are
often forced to work in hazardous conditions, beg for food and money, and face
the threat of violence and abuse daily. Child labour is still a rampant
practice that must be addressed and resolved.</p>



<p>Without a safe
shelter, these children are exposed to a variety of dangers, including
exploitation, trafficking, and violence. In addition to physical dangers, these
children are also at risk of developing mental health issues such as depression
and anxiety, which can have long-term effects on their overall development.</p>



<p>Providing street
children with a safe shelter is crucial to protecting and supporting them. Safe
shelters can provide a temporary home for these children and offer them
protection from the dangers of the streets. They can also provide them with
access to necessities such as food, clothing, and healthcare, as well as
education and vocational training.</p>



<p>Safe shelters can
also provide a sense of stability and support for these children, allowing them
to develop healthy relationships and social skills. This can help them to
transition back into society and lead successful, productive lives.</p>



<p>In the case of young
girls, many of them hail from villages and hamlets and wind up on the streets
of big cities. Many of these girls have either fled their homes or got
separated from them. They are often victims of trafficking, kidnapping, or
domestic violence. For girls surviving on the streets alone, each day is filled
with numerous difficulties and dangers. They frequently face instances of
sexual assault, physical abuse, and efforts to coerce them into prostitution. These
girls yearn to be under a roof where they can rest soundly at night.</p>



<p>This is why
governments, NGOs, and individuals must work together to ensure that street
children are protected, supported, and given the resources, they need to
succeed. This includes providing safe shelters, educational facilities,
healthcare, and job training, as well as addressing the underlying issues that
force children onto the streets.</p>



<p>Salaam Balaak Trust,
a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charitable trust in Delhi</a>, offers a sensitive and nurturing setting for street and
working children and other vulnerable children. It aims to offer children a
place where they can realise their full potential and have access to a safe
shelter, an education, and good health and nutrition. So, wait no more and make
an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online donation in India</a>&nbsp;to support India&#8217;s children and give them a
promising future.</p>
