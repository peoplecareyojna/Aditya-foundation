<p>Street children are one of the most ignored marginalized communities that need urgent help. They are not given access to their basic rights and more often not, many children grow up without having access to resources like education, regular meals, a safe shelter, proper healthcare facilities etc. Instead, children lead a vulnerable life on the dangerous streets of India. They end up growing up without any supervision or mentoring. Millions of children in India grow up without basic utilities. They fend for themselves in varied ways. Children end up choosing the illegal route where they engage in child labour.</p>



<p>Child labour essentially means children work to earn money. This may include a few hours every day, a one-time gig, or full-time jobs. Children are illegally employed in factories, engaged in domestic labour, restaurants, stalls etc. Even though it is unethical and illegal, children are employed all over India. It is extremely unhealthy and unsafe but underprivileged children start working from such a tender age to survive with the bare minimum wages that they earn.</p>



<p>Ragpicking is another common sight where children can be seen at bus stands and railway stations. Children pick and sort material that is then sold for recycling. This is how children earn – they collect from anything made of plastic (typically water bottles) to paper and tin. This is why so many children can be found with gunny bags and loitering near dustbins and other filthy sections.</p>



<p>Many children also become porters to transfer material from one place to another. This requirement is typically at railway stations, bus stands, wholesale markets, and godowns. This is also an excruciatingly painful, tiring, and overwhelming task where children have to push or pull the weight on a cart for short or long distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust is an&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi</a>&nbsp;that has been working tirelessly to uplift and empower street children. SBT, a reputed and well-established non-profit organization, rescues and rehabilitates children living on the streets through its many programs. SBT ensures children have access to proper education, a safe shelter, healthcare facilities, and regular hot and nutritious meals. Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation</a>&nbsp;can help children in India and ensure they have a promising and positive future ahead. So, connect with SBT and donate now to help make a difference!</p>

<p>Republic Day is commemorated on 26th January. This is an integral occasion for all Indians as it is the day when the nation marched towards democracy and the Declaration of Indian Independence was issued. The country has had many milestones since then and varied developments have been quite fruitful in the global context. The children of India who live on the streets still have a long way to go. Unfortunately, they continue to live a life of deprivation where they long for safety and protection.</p>



<p>India is a strong nation with many possibilities and opportunities extended to its people across the globe. Underprivileged children, however, have a hard time living without basic resources. They are deprived of all basic resources, including shelter, food, education etc. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> have a hard time living in unpredictable and overwhelming environments that affect them in more ways than one – physically as well as psychologically.Many children end up working at varied places to find odd jobs, thus engaging in child labour. Child abuse is another awful practice that several children become a part of – be it due to prostitution, gangs and other harmful practices.</p>



<p>It is time
children receive love and care, as well as access to healthcare resources etc
to be able to have a healthy and productive childhood. Children must be able to
play with other children, experience joy and jubilation, and have a prosperous
future, devoid of negativity and hostility.</p>



<p>This
Republic Day, let’s pledge to be more forthcoming towards the welfare of street
children. They must also be seen, heard and welcomed as an integral part of
society. Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most respected and trusted non-profit
organisations in India, has been working diligently towards the betterment of
street and working children. SBT has set up many Children’s Homes to ensure
children receive resources that help them in learning and growing properly.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for the children</a> of India and protect their future. After all, a country’s growth is directly related to the opportunities and resources its children have. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s programs and extend better and wholesome living conditions for children. Donate now!</p>

<p>Many children in India are victims of child labour, child trafficking, and child abuse. There are many atrocities that they face due to unsupervised living and in the company of shady characters that are looking after their vested interests. All children require responsible and helpful mentors to help guide them through troubles, life lessons, and other learning experiences. </p>



<p>The impact of abuse of any sort can leave a long-lasting imprint on the psyche of children. It can have severe and unexpected effects on the personality of the children as well. Without love and care, children feel lost and have a difficult time dealing with the many changes around them, and such horrific incidents can hamper their development in many ways.</p>



<p>Many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>&nbsp;end up resorting to drugs to handle the pressure of dealing with abuse while others join gangs or the company of untoward people on the streets to feel somewhat safe and protected. In reality, they are anything but safe as they often begin participating in illegal activities like selling drugs, pick-pocketing etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positive and productive environment, proper infrastructure, and generous care are basic needs for underprivileged children who have lived on the streets. They also require basic education, healthcare facilities, safe shelter, and responsible adults around them to support and encourage them. Extra-curricular activities are also essential to help nurture children and give them the platform to express themselves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organization in India, works relentlessly to provide all of the aforementioned facilities at the SBT shelter homes for boys and girls. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working in the area of children’s welfare for the last several decades. They have rescued and rehabilitated several children and even reunited many of them with their families. Such efforts have improved the lives of many children and given a new lease to them where they have grown up to have successful careers. You can also support SBT’s programs and support underprivileged children by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and also availing a 50% tax deduction under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.

<p>The world is experiencing a vulnerable time due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. Governments across the world have been taking precautionary steps to control the spread of the pandemic and protect the people from further damage. Many lives have been lost and several people are struggling every day and experiencing the impact of these unprecedented times. India is also seeing a sudden change in its functioning as the country has been on lockdown for several weeks now. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a>, in particular, have been one of the worst affected groups that have been bearing the brunt of the nationwide lockdown.</p>



<p>India has the largest child population in the world, with thousands of
children currently suffering due to the extreme shortage of food as poverty has
multi-fold while battling the repercussions of the pandemic. Be it children
working as ragpickers in cities, engaging in labour at factories or farms, or
selling items like balloons, pens and other knick-knacks at traffic lights, any
meagre wages that children were receiving to make ends meet somehow, has come
to a painful halt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides child labour, children who were able to receive an education are
currently not able to go to school due to the schools being closed. Though many
children have the advantage of learning their lessons digitally, most street
children do not have the luxury to access a smartphone to connect with their
teachers online or make the most of the online resources to stay updated with
their studies. This leaves a dangerous gap in their learning curve that may
result in several children lagging behind, failing or, unfortunately, dropping
out once the schools reopen.</p>



<p>Child labour is a serious issue in India that must be addressed and
given due importance. Salaam Baalak Trust, a non profit organisation in India,
is working very hard to reach out to more children since the lockdown and
provide them and their families with the necessary tools and resources to stay
safe and healthy. Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">donation</a>&nbsp;can help SBT
make remarkable strides toward the welfare of street and working children in
India. So wait no more and support Salaam Baalak Trust.</p>

<p>Street children often take up innumerable jobs to make ends meet. In order to survive in the harsh conditions of the streets, children ought to fend for themselves, to be able to provide bare minimum utilities for themselves, like food, clothing, shelter. Even though most children make-do with the basics, or often barely so, they engage in odd jobs to survive on the streets. Street children face a lot many hurdles to work for a basic wage &#8211; they can often take everyday-odd jobs or work regularly at a place that is quite hazardous to them &#8211; mentally, physically, and even emotionally. Following are some of the jobs that working children engage in for basic survival.</p>



<p>Laborers<br>Children work in factories that are horribly unsafe, unhealthy and underpaid. From working in factories that moves coal and makes crackers to garment warehouses and restaurants, children can be seen working for long hours and in extreme weather conditions. They constantly experience burnout.</p>



<p>Rag-Picking<br>This is a common sight in India &#8211; children can be seen with gunny bags that help them carry any number of things &#8211; from plastic bottles to paper and tin. Anything that can be recycled or even used at their temporary place of stay is picked up by these children. They can also be found near dustbins and other dumping grounds picking material. </p>



<p>Odd Jobs<br>Many children are involved in occupations that are temporary and that offer day-to-day earnings. From messenger-boys to cleaners, peddlers and even petty-hawkers, children are often involved in irregular tasks.</p>



<p>Porters<br>One may often come across street children working at wholesale markets, railway stations, bus stands, and even godowns. Children carry varied weights of material and have to often pull or push them to short or even long distances. </p>



<p>If you have come across <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> carrying out any of the above tasks, or even know about how children in India are living in such dire circumstances, then take the plunge to help Salaam Baalak Trust. The non-profit organization works for street and working children to empower them with education, safe shelter and performing arts. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a> right away.</p>

<p>There are millions of children that go to work in the morning to earn their daily wages. This is the pattern that has been set for them, and the reason behind their deteriorating health &#8211; mental, physical and emotional. Innumerable children, in varied tiers of India, are suffering through their childhood instead of enjoying the joys of these early formative years. Child labour is a reality that has become a norm for most people, which is more horrifying, as people are comfortable with the idea of having a young child serve them tea at a <em><g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">dhaba</g></em>&nbsp;or other local shops. Children can even be found washing dishes at the back of restaurants, sitting at<em>&nbsp;paan</em>&nbsp;shops, or polishing shoes on many busy streets. </p>



<p>Reasons for Participation<br>There are many industries where you’d notice the prevalence of child labour, most of which takes places if the child in question is an orphan, lives with relatives who want them to pull their weight, or because their own parents are poverty-stricken and need an extra pair of hands to add to the minimal family income. Many children are runaways; these street children do not have any guardians or other resources to direct them towards the right path of a healthy childhood.</p>



<p>Places of Occurrence<br>There are many hazardous places like different types of factories where you’d find children working long hours. They participate in dangerous activities to earn below-minimum wages, and even end up sacrificing their health, e.g. factories that make garments, tobacco, crackers etc, and many other unstructured establishments, hire young children to work for them.</p>



<p>Spending Time with Family and Friends<br>Child labour takes children away from playing with other children &#8211; an activity that greatly impacts their mental and social development. With such play-time activities, children learn to foster friendships &#8211; positive bonds with other people help them become confident, compassionate and caring individuals.</p>



<p>Child labour is a stark reality of our society, one that needs to be broken down and repaired at the earliest. Millions of children are suffering on a daily basis for basic necessities like food, clothing and shelter, and are unaware of requirements like education that they need to be involved in, to add real value to their life. </p>

<p>There are millions of street children in India &#8211; unfortunately, the number has only spiked in the last decade. There are many reasons why children become runaways, hawkers, thieves, work odd jobs, or do absolutely nothing in life &#8211; nothing productive anyway.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> spend their lives on the streets of big market areas amid all of the hustle-bustle, or throw away their nights and days on railway stations. A lot many homeless children can also be found loitering or begging on the steps of places of worship (mosques, temples, Gurudwaras etc) or making themselves invisible in busy areas of bus depots or abandoned areas under bridges, behind massive parking lots etc. The life of a child living on the street is one full of dread. Unspeakable living conditions, minimal nutrition, and barely able to keep themselves safe (mentally, physical or emotionally) is what a young child goes through on a daily basis. To understand the situation better, it is integral to know the types that are included under the term ‘street child’.</p>
<p>There are mainly three broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Children that live with their families on the street &#8211; These children are more commonly under the category of ‘working children’ as well, often as added help to their families to meet the minimum needs of the family.</li>
<li>Children that have remote interaction with their families &#8211; They usually live on their own (could also be part of other groups of street children). Their economic survival is usually negligible.</li>
<li>Children that have absolutely no connection with their families &#8211; These children are usually runaways or orphans, and are more vulnerable to abuse and extremely inhuman living conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several reasons as to why street children live in such life-threatening conditions &#8211; one of the main being poverty, abuse, lack of adult guidance, lack of education etc, thus making the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/projects.php">rescue of abandoned children</a> even more integral and urgent.</p>
<p>Salaam Baalak Trust came into existence to help street and working children restore their lives and lead respectable, safe and happy lives ahead. The non profit organisation has been dedicated towards helping disadvantaged children lead purposeful lives, where they are included into the society with open arms, devoid of judgement or malice.</p>
<p>SBT has been running several programs that include the rescue of street children, and successfully reuniting them with their families in many cases. If you don’t want to turn a blind eye any further, and want to ensure that no more children roam aimlessly and anxiously on the streets of our country, reach out to Salaam Baalak Trust at <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/</a> and join their efforts.</p>
