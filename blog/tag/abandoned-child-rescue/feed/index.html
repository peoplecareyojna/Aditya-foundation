<p>Children in our country hold the key to a developed country with a bright future. However, not all of them receive the treatment they merit. Unfortunately, our country&#8217;s street children suffer the most from the economic downturn, shoddy infrastructure, and crumbling system. To ensure that they develop into better citizens of the country, it is crucial to give them all of your attention and goodness. <br><br>Innumerable children who end up on the streets have actually run away from home. They flee because they frequently strive to avoid domestic abuse and even early marriages. When they move to a new city or area, they frequently accept low-paying employment and often resort to begging. These children experience physical, mental, and even sexual abuse in such situations. Therefore, it is crucial to protect them from such horrors.&nbsp;<br><br>Numerous NGOs are working to provide street children with the best lives they can have – but it is a herculean task that requires all the support possible, and then some. Salaam Baalak Trust is one of the most respected and trusted organisations, dedicated to helping street children. The NGO, based in New Delhi, has been fervently carrying out child-centric programmes to help make a real difference in the lives of street and working children. SBT provides them with education, clothing, healthcare, and shelter. Most importantly, the non-profit organisation provides love, care, and protection – something they have almost never experienced. &nbsp;The improvement in children&#8217;s life is the major goal – for a wholesome childhood and a promising future. </p>



<p>SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues street children</a>&nbsp;and improves their quality of life through collective and constant efforts. And you can also help by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and contribute towards their well-being. In addition to a generous contribution, you can volunteer at SBT too. This may include activities like Yoga, dance, music, and more. Volunteers from India and the world look forward to their time volunteering at SBT and going back home with priceless experiences. Donate for the welfare of street children and ensure they are protected from the harsh and unforgiving streets of India. Support now!</p>

<p>Diwali is here &#8211; the wonderful festival of lights that brings prosperity and joy into our lives. But this is not the case for street children. Millions of children go to work every day to earn daily wages. This is their reality of street children and the reason behind their deteriorating health &#8211; mental, physical and emotional. Countless children from all walks of life in India spend their childhood working hard to earn any basic wages to have access to some resources to survive. Instead of enjoying the joys of these early growth periods, they work long hours and are involved in tedious chores. Child labour has become the norm for most people where they don&#8217;t bat an eye when children beg on the streets or work at a roadside stall or as domestic help etc. Children can even be seen washing dishes behind the restaurant, sitting at paan shops, or shining shoes on many busy streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason for their participation in multiple areas of work is because they have no other option to survive. Most underprivileged children are orphans and live in abject poverty. Many are also abandoned while others work to help contribute to their family’s minimum income. Many children run away from home; these street children do not have any guardians or other resources to guide them on the right path to a healthy childhood.</p>



<p>There are many dangerous places such as different types of factories etc where children can be found working in extreme heat or bitter cold. They participate in dangerous activities to earn less than the minimum wage, even at the expense of their health. Children can be seen working at factories that produce clothing, crackers, tobacco, biscuits, etc, and many other unstructured businesses that employ young children to work for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Child labour keeps children away from playing with other children which is extremely harmful to a child during their impressionable years. This greatly affects their psychological and social development. Through proper playtime activities, children learn to cultivate friendship and nurture positive connections with others which helps them become confident, compassionate and caring people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the true essence of Diwali, an auspicious occasion, you can donate to Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has been working for the welfare of street children for over 30 years. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">Donate for children&#8217;s medical aid</a> and help SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescue abandoned children</a>.

<p>Across the country, many children face daily struggles due to the harsh life on the streets. Millions of children in India are experiencing abuse, exploitation, hunger, and exclusion. The basic rights of children are also not extended to them – this includes the right to safety and protection, right to clean water, right to regular and healthy meals, right education, right to safe shelter, and the right to access to healthcare facilities.</p>



<p>The rights of children cannot be ignored and to ensure the same,
April 12th is marked as International Day for Street Children. This day is
commemorated to ensure that the condition of street children is brought to the
forefront and their plight is given a platform to address. It is high time
underprivileged children have a collective support system to help them step out
of the vicious cycle. The patterns of abuse, exploitation, illiteracy, and
poverty lead to many other long-term repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fundamental and constructive change is the need of the hour as
several children can still be seen begging at traffic signals, engaging in
labour work and other menial jobs to make ends meet somehow, or becoming a
ragpicker. Be it as domestic help or joining street gangs, children do anything
to survive as there is no mentoring or support system in place to guide them
through their impressionable years.</p>



<p>The International Day of Street Children is important as it helps raise much-needed awareness on the plight of the street and working children who have been discriminated against for far too long. This is where Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s reputed non-profit organisation, has been diligently working on for more than 30 years. SBT provides all of the integral resources for street and working children and also <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues abandoned children</a>. SBT offers full care and protection to the children and ensures that they have access to health and nutrition, mental health, and quality education. The children are placed in various Children’s Homes and also enrolled in vocational training programs to help them build their personalities and expand their minds. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php"> </a></strong>and celebrate the true spirit of International Day for Street Children.

<p>Street children are not a rare sight in India. They are all around us and unfortunately, it has become normal to see them and not pay heed to their existence on the streets. Children are the future of every country as they lead the nation forward towards newer developments and heights of success. But millions of children in India are living on the streets and looking after themselves however they best can.</p>



<p>All children require necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. There are other integral resources too that help contributes to their development like healthcare facilities, participation in extra-curricular activities etc. Having responsible and caring adults around also helps provide them with a support system that is much-required during the initial impressionable years of children. The streets are harsh and deprived of such resources that further deteriorate their living conditions. Living in such extreme vulnerable conditions, that too, at such a young age, can be traumatising and that is why many children on the streets resort to drug abuse, violence etc.</p>



<p>The
fundamental requirement in the case of street children is the understanding of
their basic rights and provide them with those like basic education. Attending
school and receiving a quality education is essential for underprivileged
children. It not only helps them move past the vicious cycle of poverty and get
stable jobs in the future but also helps them grow up to be responsible and
driven individuals who strive for success.</p>



<p>This is where Salaam Baalak Trust comes into the picture as the well-known and reputed non-profit organisation has been working for the welfare of street children. SBT, based out of Delhi in India, focuses on <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescuing street children</a><strong> </strong>and help them rehabilitate and readjust in society. Many children are also helped in reuniting them with their families. Several children get separated from their families and SBT helps them find their homes.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a> and help them have a real chance at a prosperous future. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s efforts to ensure more children have access to basic education, medical support, healthy meals etc. Donate now to make a difference!</p>

<p>We all know about the existence of street children in India. Their presence is apparent to everyone yet most of us to choose to ignore them. It is a deplorable state of affairs to see how children, who require constant and an abundance of support, are deprived of basic resources and mentorship. They roam around the streets to fend for themselves. They may even be seen working odd jobs at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>, rag-picking at railway stations, shoe cleaning in busy streets, or even begging at temples and bus stands etc.</p>



<p>Many people try to&nbsp;rescue street children,&nbsp;temporarily, by giving them some money or a meal to eat. This is an act of kindness but one that is hardly part of the solution. Some people even think that employing poor children at their homes to do the domestic chores will help, when in fact, it is an act of engaging in child labour. This contributes to more harm than good and affects the psychological and physical well-being of the child.&nbsp;It is to be noted that no child must ever engage in any sort of labour. These impressionable years require for children to study, play with other children of their age group, participate in extra-curricular activities, watch informative visual content etc. Instead, rescuing&nbsp;abandoned street children&nbsp;becomes an even more distant dream when the plight of their street life is observed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many individuals, government agencies and non-profit organizations in India that are working hard to improve the struggles of street children and help provide them with short-term and/or long-term support. One of the NGOs that is known to offer generous support and a commendable platform to underprivileged children is Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi. This non-profit has been working in the respective field for more than 30 years and has protected many children by placing them in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter for street children</a>. The children are offered nutritious meals, a safe shelter, nurturing guardians, and playmates of their age for them to uplift the quality of their life. You can also help Salaam Baalak Trust in their endeavour to empower street children and ensure that they lead happier and healthier lives. So wait no more and join in to help more children lead a life without hardships and sufferings. Donate now!</p>
