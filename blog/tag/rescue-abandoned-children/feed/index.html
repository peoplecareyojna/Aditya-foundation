<p>Diwali is here &#8211; the wonderful festival of lights that brings prosperity and joy into our lives. But this is not the case for street children. Millions of children go to work every day to earn daily wages. This is their reality of street children and the reason behind their deteriorating health &#8211; mental, physical and emotional. Countless children from all walks of life in India spend their childhood working hard to earn any basic wages to have access to some resources to survive. Instead of enjoying the joys of these early growth periods, they work long hours and are involved in tedious chores. Child labour has become the norm for most people where they don&#8217;t bat an eye when children beg on the streets or work at a roadside stall or as domestic help etc. Children can even be seen washing dishes behind the restaurant, sitting at paan shops, or shining shoes on many busy streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason for their participation in multiple areas of work is because they have no other option to survive. Most underprivileged children are orphans and live in abject poverty. Many are also abandoned while others work to help contribute to their family’s minimum income. Many children run away from home; these street children do not have any guardians or other resources to guide them on the right path to a healthy childhood.</p>



<p>There are many dangerous places such as different types of factories etc where children can be found working in extreme heat or bitter cold. They participate in dangerous activities to earn less than the minimum wage, even at the expense of their health. Children can be seen working at factories that produce clothing, crackers, tobacco, biscuits, etc, and many other unstructured businesses that employ young children to work for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Child labour keeps children away from playing with other children which is extremely harmful to a child during their impressionable years. This greatly affects their psychological and social development. Through proper playtime activities, children learn to cultivate friendship and nurture positive connections with others which helps them become confident, compassionate and caring people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the true essence of Diwali, an auspicious occasion, you can donate to Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has been working for the welfare of street children for over 30 years. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">Donate for children&#8217;s medical aid</a> and help SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescue abandoned children</a>.

<p>We all know about the existence of street children in India. Their presence is apparent to everyone yet most of us to choose to ignore them. It is a deplorable state of affairs to see how children, who require constant and an abundance of support, are deprived of basic resources and mentorship. They roam around the streets to fend for themselves. They may even be seen working odd jobs at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>, rag-picking at railway stations, shoe cleaning in busy streets, or even begging at temples and bus stands etc.</p>



<p>Many people try to&nbsp;rescue street children,&nbsp;temporarily, by giving them some money or a meal to eat. This is an act of kindness but one that is hardly part of the solution. Some people even think that employing poor children at their homes to do the domestic chores will help, when in fact, it is an act of engaging in child labour. This contributes to more harm than good and affects the psychological and physical well-being of the child.&nbsp;It is to be noted that no child must ever engage in any sort of labour. These impressionable years require for children to study, play with other children of their age group, participate in extra-curricular activities, watch informative visual content etc. Instead, rescuing&nbsp;abandoned street children&nbsp;becomes an even more distant dream when the plight of their street life is observed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many individuals, government agencies and non-profit organizations in India that are working hard to improve the struggles of street children and help provide them with short-term and/or long-term support. One of the NGOs that is known to offer generous support and a commendable platform to underprivileged children is Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi. This non-profit has been working in the respective field for more than 30 years and has protected many children by placing them in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter for street children</a>. The children are offered nutritious meals, a safe shelter, nurturing guardians, and playmates of their age for them to uplift the quality of their life. You can also help Salaam Baalak Trust in their endeavour to empower street children and ensure that they lead happier and healthier lives. So wait no more and join in to help more children lead a life without hardships and sufferings. Donate now!</p>
