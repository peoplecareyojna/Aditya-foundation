<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-1024x682.jpeg" alt="Healthcare for Street Children" class="wp-image-395" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the heart of bustling cities, there exists an expansive group that is often overlooked and forgotten: street children. These young souls, braving the harsh realities of life on the streets, face an uphill battle against not only poverty and neglect but also a lack of access to proper healthcare. The need to protect underprivileged children and provide them with comprehensive healthcare support is paramount, as it directly impacts their chances of having a healthy, happy childhood and a promising future.</p>



<p>Imagine a childhood spent without the warmth of a secure home, without proper nourishment, and without the protection of basic medical care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> are exposed to numerous health risks, from malnutrition and respiratory infections to injuries sustained on the unforgiving streets. The absence of timely medical attention exacerbates their vulnerability, jeopardising their overall well-being. By extending proper healthcare to these children, we ensure not only their physical health but also their mental and emotional resilience.</p>



<p>A healthy childhood
is the foundation upon which a promising future is built. Adequate healthcare
plays an indispensable role in nurturing the potential of at-risk children,
enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and adversity. When these children
receive regular medical check-ups, vaccinations, and treatments, they are
better equipped to focus on their education and personal growth. By addressing
their health needs, we pave the way for a brighter tomorrow where these
children can contribute positively to society.</p>



<p>Moreover, providing
healthcare support to underserved children sends a powerful message—that they
matter. When we invest in their well-being, we communicate their worth and
dignity as individuals. This fosters a sense of belonging and instills in them
the confidence to dream big. A healthy childhood brings with it a sense of
normalcy, offering these children a chance to experience the joys and wonders that
every child deserves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a beacon of hope, is dedicated to uplifting street and working children. With unwavering commitment, they provide essential medical aid, nurturing these young lives towards brighter futures. By offering healthcare and resources, SBT ensures that vulnerable children receive the care they deserve. Your support can change lives, offering these children a chance for better health and opportunities. Let&#8217;s come together to create lasting change. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for Street children</a> and become a part of SBT&#8217;s inspiring journey.</p>

<p>In a world where the marginalised are deprived of their basic rights, it falls upon the privileged communities to extend a helping hand to at-risk groups and uplift their current circumstances. Among these vulnerable groups, children bear the brunt of dire conditions on the streets, subjecting them to physical, mental, and emotional hardships. Thus, it is imperative to address their medical needs and provide them with the necessary support.</p>



<p>Street children
endure unimaginable hardships, lacking access to basic necessities, healthcare,
and protection. They face numerous hazards, including malnutrition, abuse,
exploitation, and poor living conditions, which jeopardise their well-being and
future prospects. Urgent action is needed to address their medical needs and
offer them a lifeline.</p>



<p>There are many
government initiatives, individuals, and the efforts of dedicated organisations
that are creating a safer and healthier environment for street and working
children. Through medical camps, outreach programmes, and collaborations with
healthcare professionals, these organisations aim to provide essential medical
attention to these children. By focusing on multifaceted approaches, they seek
to meet the urgent medical requirements of these vulnerable children.</p>

<p>Street children in India face a multitude of challenges, including poor living conditions, limited access to education, and inadequate healthcare. Providing quality medical care for these vulnerable children is not just a basic human right; it is also crucial for their overall well-being and future prospects.</p>



<p>Many of the at-risk children lack access to basic medical
aid such as vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care.
This is due to a variety of factors, including poverty, social exclusion, and
discrimination. Without access to proper medical support, street children are
more likely to suffer from serious illnesses and injuries, and their physical
and mental development can be affected.</p>



<p>In addition to physical healthcare, it is also important
to address the mental health of street children. These children often face
traumatic experiences such as abuse, neglect, and violence. The stress and
anxiety associated with living on the streets can also take a toll on their
mental health. However, mental health issues are often overlooked, with little
attention paid to the psychological needs of street children. This can have
serious long-term consequences, including a higher risk of developing mental
health disorders and difficulties in social and emotional development.</p>



<p>To address these issues, it is crucial to provide quality
medical support that is accessible and culturally sensitive. Healthcare
providers should be trained to understand the unique needs of street children
and provide care that is tailored to their specific circumstances. This
includes addressing the mental health needs of street children and providing
appropriate counselling and support.</p>



<p>One way to improve access to <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach-and-community-projects.php">medical aid for street children</a> is through mobile clinics. These clinics can travel to areas where street children congregate, such as railway stations, bus stops, and parks. They can provide basic healthcare services, including vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care. Mobile clinics can also provide mental health support and counselling, which is crucial for addressing the mental health needs of street children.</p>



<p>Another way to address the healthcare needs of street
children is through partnerships between healthcare providers and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that work with street children. These
partnerships can provide a more comprehensive approach to healthcare,
addressing both physical and mental health needs. NGOs can also provide a safe
space for street children to access healthcare without fear of discrimination
or stigma.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust is one such <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/"> </a></strong>that provides varied resources of paramount importance to the welfare of street and working children in India. SBT ensures it provides a safe and protective environment for these children, who face painful and horrific experiences on the streets that are often unspeakable. Your <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation in India</a> can help SBT provide healthcare aid that is accessible, culturally sensitive, and addresses their unique needs. Support now!</p>

<p>What do you mean by a powerful country? Is it their people, their financial resources, or their natural resources? Leaders all around the world would emphasise that a nation is made up of its people and their strengths. After all, it is true that a nation&#8217;s intellectual capacity is its most valuable asset. So, investing in nutrition is not a choice but rather a must, especially in the context of the future of any country &#8211; its children. </p>



<p>The sad reality is that we have failed to equip our population, our children, and our future leaders with the fundamental principles of nutrition. Many of us who live in cities are more concerned about choosing which cuisine to eat from all the options accessible to us than worrying about those who are experiencing physical pain due to starvation. There is a sizable portion of children who are barely hanging on and are fighting hunger at all times. They simply aim to consume any type of food to maintain their health and survive another day.</p>



<p>A complete plate of food is required for every child. To help disadvantaged children grow properly, especially those living on the streets, wholesome food is crucial. Daily protect them from ailments because they are full of the goodness of nutrients. Taking care of children and ensuring their healthy development as they grow up is one of the most crucial aspects of any form of development. The reality in India, however, is quite different. We have consistently failed to give our children the most basic care, including nutritious meals, which has led to their stunted growth and other nutritional issues.</p>



<p>Numerous students struggle with unrecognised hunger. You can help make a difference by donating to SBT, a reputable <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Indian NGO in Delhi NCR</a> that has been running child-centric programmes to help India’s children have a happier and healthier future. SBT offers a sensitive and nurturing atmosphere for street and working children. SBT aims to give children a place where they can realise their full potential and their rights to a secure environment, an education, and good health and nutrition. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for children</a> to ensure they have access to their birthright of daily meals!</p>

<p>National Education Day is an occasion that commemorates the need for all children to be educated. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">education for street children</a> is still not a reality in most parts of India. The number of children living on the streets and working hard to survive has been steadily rising. Education is not even on their radar amidst the struggle to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Innumerable underprivileged children wind up on the streets for a variety of reasons. Many of them travel to Delhi from their impoverished backgrounds in search of chances and a better life. Some run away from their homes due to abusive and careless guardians, while others have been reported to be cut off from their relatives and are unable to contact them again. The suffering of these children as they struggle on the unpredictable streets of India is a wake-up call for the entire nation.</p>



<p>Presently, children can be seen doing varied random activities on the streets, be it selling knick-knacks at traffic signals, begging, picking up trash, or worse, engaging in illegal activities. This is not the life fit for anyone &#8211; definitely not for children.</p>



<p>A Tough Life<br>The problems that Delhi&#8217;s street children face are numerous. Children not only endure a rough life that is frequently dangerous and without shelter, but they also have to deal with violence and brutality. Adults abuse young children, compel them to work, beg, and commit crimes. They are also verbally, physically, and emotionally abused. There have been reports of abuse and violence against more than half of the population of street children, and so much of it still goes unreported. The majority of children lack ID cards or other documents that would allow them to participate in government programmes that supply essentials to minors. The world&#8217;s greatest concentration of street children is thought to be in India.</p>



<p>Protection and Rehabilitation<br>Numerous NGOs have been extending support in many forms to support street children. One such NGO that has dedicated years of effort to the well-being of India&#8217;s street children is Salaam Baalak Trust. SBT offers food, clothing, healthcare, education, and most importantly, love and care. This National Education Day, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for children&#8217;s education</a> to help give them a promising future, one that enables them to pursue their dreams and eventually have a job to pay their bills. Let’s give a better life to them!</p>

<p>We all strive to grow and thrive with the help of the many resources at our disposal. We desire the best in everything in our life, including relationships, good health, and successful careers. However, street children do not have the luxury to do so as they live with little or no resources. Their birthright of having access to a safe shelter, regular meals, education, and overall protection is not extended to them. Rather, children go through helplessness to make ends meet and many times, they end up getting involved in illegal activities like pickpocketing, prostitution, etc.</p>



<p>Street children are susceptible to innumerable uncertainties at every nook and corner on a daily basis. The dangers of being surrounded by aggressive adults in overwhelming and harsh environments, without any supervision, make them more prone to violence and abuse. This is one of the many reasons why children living on the streets frequently give in to drug use. Their mental health deteriorates due to daily beatings, working long hours for minimum wages, loneliness etc. Many children are runaways who have faced abuse in varied forms and try to escape that life, only to fall into a similar or worse trap of the unforgiving streets of India. This makes matters worse for their mental health with each passing year.</p>



<p>It is time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a>&nbsp;and give them a better life, one that is full of promise and opportunities. Several non-profit organisations are working hard to run child-centric programmes that improve the quality of life of children. Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed NGO that has been rescuing and rehabilitating street children. SBT provides full care and protection to street children and ensures they are well taken care of. For a few decades now, SBT has been providing shelter homes, educational opportunities, healthcare facilities, and healthy meals. Many of these underprivileged children have gone on to become successful artists, entrepreneurs, working professionals, social workers etc. They have been encouraged, supported, and championed to evolve and maximise their potential. Your donation to SBT, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi NCR</a>, shall support Salaam Baalak Trust’s tireless work to protect children in need. So wait no more and support now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Street-Children-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-299" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Street-Children-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Street-Children-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Street-Children-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Street-Children.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><br>India has a large population of street children. Using India&#8217;s massive rail system, children run away from their homes to escape abuse, violence, and poverty. They travel to big cities in the hopes of leaving that overwhelmingly difficult life behind, only to find themselves in the underbelly of the streets, alone and deprived. When thousands of children arrive at India&#8217;s enormous and crowded train stations, they are disoriented, afraid, and alone, with no idea what to do. They are forced to live on the platforms after having their ambitions ruthlessly crushed. This is happening with innumerable children on a daily basis.</p>



<p>For several troublesome reasons, children flee their homes or are compelled to do so. Many people desire a better future and the chance to work in urban areas. But without any resources at all, they are neither able to survive on the streets nor reunite with their families.</p>



<p>Abusers looking to take advantage of vulnerable and lonely children roam around in the hopes of finding these children to make them their prey for vested interests. They either exploit them by engaging the children in child labour or other forms of child trafficking, or other illegal activities like robbery, prostitution etc. This also compels many children to turn to substance misuse to handle their mental health and many other difficulties but addiction only makes matters worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s well-known&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a>, has been working hard to help rescue and rehabilitate underprivileged children. SBT has been running multiple shelter homes to ensure children have access to food, shelter, safety, and assistance. SBT has been working hard for their welfare for over 30 years. It is time to protect more children and prevent them from being ignored or abused, and that is why SBT runs varied child-centric programmes besides its education programmes for children. The activities include mental health support, performing arts workshops, sports practices etc. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a>&nbsp;to help make a difference and gift a better and more promising future to these forgotten children.</p>

<p>Street children are one of the most ignored marginalized communities that need urgent help. They are not given access to their basic rights and more often not, many children grow up without having access to resources like education, regular meals, a safe shelter, proper healthcare facilities etc. Instead, children lead a vulnerable life on the dangerous streets of India. They end up growing up without any supervision or mentoring. Millions of children in India grow up without basic utilities. They fend for themselves in varied ways. Children end up choosing the illegal route where they engage in child labour.</p>



<p>Child labour essentially means children work to earn money. This may include a few hours every day, a one-time gig, or full-time jobs. Children are illegally employed in factories, engaged in domestic labour, restaurants, stalls etc. Even though it is unethical and illegal, children are employed all over India. It is extremely unhealthy and unsafe but underprivileged children start working from such a tender age to survive with the bare minimum wages that they earn.</p>



<p>Ragpicking is another common sight where children can be seen at bus stands and railway stations. Children pick and sort material that is then sold for recycling. This is how children earn – they collect from anything made of plastic (typically water bottles) to paper and tin. This is why so many children can be found with gunny bags and loitering near dustbins and other filthy sections.</p>



<p>Many children also become porters to transfer material from one place to another. This requirement is typically at railway stations, bus stands, wholesale markets, and godowns. This is also an excruciatingly painful, tiring, and overwhelming task where children have to push or pull the weight on a cart for short or long distances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust is an&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi</a>&nbsp;that has been working tirelessly to uplift and empower street children. SBT, a reputed and well-established non-profit organization, rescues and rehabilitates children living on the streets through its many programs. SBT ensures children have access to proper education, a safe shelter, healthcare facilities, and regular hot and nutritious meals. Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation</a>&nbsp;can help children in India and ensure they have a promising and positive future ahead. So, connect with SBT and donate now to help make a difference!</p>

<p>Street children are a reality and their existence must be acknowledged as a first step. There are millions of children living on the streets of India, without any adult supervision or support from society. These children are deprived of any of the basic rights – they do not have access to proper education, daily meals, healthcare facilities, or a safe shelter. The children are either runaways, orphans, have cut ties with their family, or are unable to locate them and have no other option but to live on the streets.</p>



<p>All of these children live on their own – they work odd jobs to gather some basic earnings to live off on the streets. Be it in factories or at restaurants, children are employed for odd jobs where their wages are bare minimum and their rights are compromised. Child labour is a major issue in India as children work in unhealthy and unsafe environments. At the age when they should be studying in schools and playing with other children of their age, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> put their lives in danger on a daily basis to earn money. Their mental, physical, and psychological well-being is attacked and deteriorates due to such circumstances.</p>



<p>Children’s mental health also gets affected as children need to be in a healthy environment. They deserve a safe and protected atmosphere to grow properly and healthily. Regular medical tests are also important that must include timely vaccinations. Immunizations can help protect children from avoidable diseases as avoiding these can even affect them for life, or worse, cause death.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children deserve to be around positive, encouraging, and supportive adults. They must be given playtime and tools to grow up to be independent and wholesome individuals. Many non-profit organizations are working to improve the lives of children. Salaam Baalak Trust is a renowned NGO that has been working for over 30 years to rescue and rehabilitate children. SBT is ensuring that children receive food, security, health, education and love – essentials required for children to grow up well. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a> and help make a real difference in their lives. Support Salaam Baalak Trust now!</p>

<p>Children on the streets have a tough time living a life of distress and deprivation. They are also going through a lot of uncertainty and more often than not, that ends up affecting their mental well-being. This is because street life can be extremely distressing to a child’s impressionable mind.</p>



<p>This is the age when children need to be well looked after. Instead, they have to live without any basic necessities and make several life choices on a daily basis. These integral resources include a safe shelter, quality healthcare services, hot and nutritious meals, regular education etc. But the reality is far from this, as we know. Children have to fend for themselves and typically, they end up getting stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty, illiteracy, child labour, and other forms of exploitation etc.</p>



<p>Mental health is an essential topic in the case of underprivileged children and must be addressed. There are many areas of concern when it comes to the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health of street children</a>. They may go through depression, substance abuse, anxiety, sleeplessness etc. After all, surviving on your own from a tender age can be a severely disturbing issue for a child. This is why regular medical check-ups must be conducted to ensure no mental health issue is overlooked as that may worsen the situation.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children also require proper medical support and Salaam Baalak Trust has been working relentlessly to rescue and <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/restoration.php">rehabilitate street children</a>. The non-profit organisation also ensures that there are proper records of children’s medical history of diseases, check-ups and treatments to ensure they receive the best of medical support. Regular health camps are also conducted for the children to spread awareness on the importance of good health and ensure that children’s health is not neglected anymore.</p>



<p>10th October
is commemorated as World Mental Health Day. You can generously donate for
children and ensure they are provided with proper medical support, safety and
protection, to ensure they have a positive and promising future. Join hands
with Salaam Balaak Trust and gift children a better childhood!</p>
