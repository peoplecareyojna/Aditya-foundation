<p>Street children in India face a multitude of challenges, including poor living conditions, limited access to education, and inadequate healthcare. Providing quality medical care for these vulnerable children is not just a basic human right; it is also crucial for their overall well-being and future prospects.</p>



<p>Many of the at-risk children lack access to basic medical
aid such as vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care.
This is due to a variety of factors, including poverty, social exclusion, and
discrimination. Without access to proper medical support, street children are
more likely to suffer from serious illnesses and injuries, and their physical
and mental development can be affected.</p>



<p>In addition to physical healthcare, it is also important
to address the mental health of street children. These children often face
traumatic experiences such as abuse, neglect, and violence. The stress and
anxiety associated with living on the streets can also take a toll on their
mental health. However, mental health issues are often overlooked, with little
attention paid to the psychological needs of street children. This can have
serious long-term consequences, including a higher risk of developing mental
health disorders and difficulties in social and emotional development.</p>



<p>To address these issues, it is crucial to provide quality
medical support that is accessible and culturally sensitive. Healthcare
providers should be trained to understand the unique needs of street children
and provide care that is tailored to their specific circumstances. This
includes addressing the mental health needs of street children and providing
appropriate counselling and support.</p>



<p>One way to improve access to <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach-and-community-projects.php">medical aid for street children</a> is through mobile clinics. These clinics can travel to areas where street children congregate, such as railway stations, bus stops, and parks. They can provide basic healthcare services, including vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care. Mobile clinics can also provide mental health support and counselling, which is crucial for addressing the mental health needs of street children.</p>



<p>Another way to address the healthcare needs of street
children is through partnerships between healthcare providers and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that work with street children. These
partnerships can provide a more comprehensive approach to healthcare,
addressing both physical and mental health needs. NGOs can also provide a safe
space for street children to access healthcare without fear of discrimination
or stigma.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust is one such <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/"> </a></strong>that provides varied resources of paramount importance to the welfare of street and working children in India. SBT ensures it provides a safe and protective environment for these children, who face painful and horrific experiences on the streets that are often unspeakable. Your <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation in India</a> can help SBT provide healthcare aid that is accessible, culturally sensitive, and addresses their unique needs. Support now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-6-1024x536.jpg" alt="Better World To Street Children" class="wp-image-317" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-6-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-6-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-6-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Children in our country hold the key to a developed country with a bright future. However, not all of them receive the treatment they merit. Unfortunately, our country&#8217;s street children suffer the most from the economic downturn, shoddy infrastructure, and crumbling system. To ensure that they develop into better citizens of the country, it is crucial to give them all of your attention and goodness. <br><br>Innumerable children who end up on the streets have actually run away from home. They flee because they frequently strive to avoid domestic abuse and even early marriages. When they move to a new city or area, they frequently accept low-paying employment and often resort to begging. These children experience physical, mental, and even sexual abuse in such situations. Therefore, it is crucial to protect them from such horrors.&nbsp;<br><br>Numerous NGOs are working to provide street children with the best lives they can have – but it is a herculean task that requires all the support possible, and then some. Salaam Baalak Trust is one of the most respected and trusted organisations, dedicated to helping street children. The NGO, based in New Delhi, has been fervently carrying out child-centric programmes to help make a real difference in the lives of street and working children. SBT provides them with education, clothing, healthcare, and shelter. Most importantly, the non-profit organisation provides love, care, and protection – something they have almost never experienced. &nbsp;The improvement in children&#8217;s life is the major goal – for a wholesome childhood and a promising future. </p>



<p>SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues street children</a>&nbsp;and improves their quality of life through collective and constant efforts. And you can also help by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and contribute towards their well-being. In addition to a generous contribution, you can volunteer at SBT too. This may include activities like Yoga, dance, music, and more. Volunteers from India and the world look forward to their time volunteering at SBT and going back home with priceless experiences. Donate for the welfare of street children and ensure they are protected from the harsh and unforgiving streets of India. Support now!</p>

<p>We all strive to grow and thrive with the help of the many resources at our disposal. We desire the best in everything in our life, including relationships, good health, and successful careers. However, street children do not have the luxury to do so as they live with little or no resources. Their birthright of having access to a safe shelter, regular meals, education, and overall protection is not extended to them. Rather, children go through helplessness to make ends meet and many times, they end up getting involved in illegal activities like pickpocketing, prostitution, etc.</p>



<p>Street children are susceptible to innumerable uncertainties at every nook and corner on a daily basis. The dangers of being surrounded by aggressive adults in overwhelming and harsh environments, without any supervision, make them more prone to violence and abuse. This is one of the many reasons why children living on the streets frequently give in to drug use. Their mental health deteriorates due to daily beatings, working long hours for minimum wages, loneliness etc. Many children are runaways who have faced abuse in varied forms and try to escape that life, only to fall into a similar or worse trap of the unforgiving streets of India. This makes matters worse for their mental health with each passing year.</p>



<p>It is time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a>&nbsp;and give them a better life, one that is full of promise and opportunities. Several non-profit organisations are working hard to run child-centric programmes that improve the quality of life of children. Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed NGO that has been rescuing and rehabilitating street children. SBT provides full care and protection to street children and ensures they are well taken care of. For a few decades now, SBT has been providing shelter homes, educational opportunities, healthcare facilities, and healthy meals. Many of these underprivileged children have gone on to become successful artists, entrepreneurs, working professionals, social workers etc. They have been encouraged, supported, and championed to evolve and maximise their potential. Your donation to SBT, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi NCR</a>, shall support Salaam Baalak Trust’s tireless work to protect children in need. So wait no more and support now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_1310-1024x683.jpg" alt="Donate For Street Children " class="wp-image-291" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_1310-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_1310-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_1310-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_1310.jpg 1560w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a>&nbsp;have been struggling for most of their childhood to make ends meet. It is an excruciating task to survive on the harsh streets, also known as the underbelly that is not talked about. Many day-to-day atrocities take place that severely affects children in particular. After all, their impressionable minds and developing bodies are mostly unable to bear the pressures of all the changes and dangers that they face daily.</p>



<p>Safety in many unforeseeable situations and protection from varied dangerous characters is a constant struggle. Even then, children are forced to look after themselves – without having any access to their basic rights of regular education, proper meals, healthcare facilities etc. Many street children work during these impressionable years – they can be found working long and tedious hours at the local <em>dhabas</em>, as domestic help, young girls and boys begging at traffic signals, or becoming a helper to the vegetable seller. Other children can be found rag-picking, and some end up engaging in violence, theft, and even human trafficking – either by force or due to the unfortunate turn of fate.</p>



<p>Children in need must be able to go to school and participate in varied artistic and physical activities to hone their personalities. They must be given the opportunity to shine and flourish through their skills and preferences in life. But the lack of adult supervision and little or no access to resources charts a different life trajectory – one that suppresses them and deteriorates their life. Many children also end up facing mental health issues as most children on the streets face mental, physical, and psychological trauma – that carries out for many years ahead.</p>



<p>It is time we give a real chance to millions of children on the streets to ensure they have a more fulfilling, wholesome, positive, and prosperous future. An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation in India</a>&nbsp;to a trusted and respected non-profit organization like Salaam Baalak Trust can make quite a difference to these children. So wait no more and donate to gift a promising future to street children &#8211; one that they truly deserve. You can also spread the word in your community and circle of friends and family about SBT’s programs. Come together and support these children who have been forgotten by society. Donate to Salaam Baalak Trust now!</p>

<p>All children deserve an environment with love, care, protection, and basic resources. Utilities like a safe shelter, basic education, healthy meals, and healthcare facilities are a must for children across all backgrounds. Unfortunately, this is not the case with street and working children.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">Education for street children</a>&nbsp;continues to be a distant aspiration. Instead of being an obvious requirement, many children on the streets struggle with everyday battles like protecting themselves, find scraps to eat and making ends meet to have a shelter etc. Surviving on the harsh streets can be overwhelming for a child and what makes matters worse is that they are deprived of mentors or any responsible adults around them who can help guide them.</p>



<p>This is why many children fall under the trap
of illegal activities and end up engaging with the wrong company. Several
trafficked children follow the lead of those that rob, cheat, or encourage the
children to protect themselves by harming others. Such actions affect children
for the long run where they become even more clueless about their actions and
the repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many children also face mental health issues
due to drug abuse, physical or sexual abuse, violence, abandonment, and trauma
of many types. From sleepless nights to anger issues, from addiction to lack of
social skills, underprivileged children face many tough situations that their
impressionable mind and gentle spirit is unable to process. This is why street
children need all the more positive reinforcement and constant support system
to help them recover and revive from the experiences of the underbelly of the
streets.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most reputed
non-profit organisations, works hard to give a promising future to children in
India. SBT runs multiple shelter homes for boys and girls and provides
clothing, food, and proper education for the children. SBT also runs mental
health programs and ensures that children receive quality medical resources.</p>

<p>Across the country, many children face daily struggles due to the harsh life on the streets. Millions of children in India are experiencing abuse, exploitation, hunger, and exclusion. The basic rights of children are also not extended to them – this includes the right to safety and protection, right to clean water, right to regular and healthy meals, right education, right to safe shelter, and the right to access to healthcare facilities.</p>



<p>The rights of children cannot be ignored and to ensure the same,
April 12th is marked as International Day for Street Children. This day is
commemorated to ensure that the condition of street children is brought to the
forefront and their plight is given a platform to address. It is high time
underprivileged children have a collective support system to help them step out
of the vicious cycle. The patterns of abuse, exploitation, illiteracy, and
poverty lead to many other long-term repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fundamental and constructive change is the need of the hour as
several children can still be seen begging at traffic signals, engaging in
labour work and other menial jobs to make ends meet somehow, or becoming a
ragpicker. Be it as domestic help or joining street gangs, children do anything
to survive as there is no mentoring or support system in place to guide them
through their impressionable years.</p>



<p>The International Day of Street Children is important as it helps raise much-needed awareness on the plight of the street and working children who have been discriminated against for far too long. This is where Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s reputed non-profit organisation, has been diligently working on for more than 30 years. SBT provides all of the integral resources for street and working children and also <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues abandoned children</a>. SBT offers full care and protection to the children and ensures that they have access to health and nutrition, mental health, and quality education. The children are placed in various Children’s Homes and also enrolled in vocational training programs to help them build their personalities and expand their minds. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php"> </a></strong>and celebrate the true spirit of International Day for Street Children.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/donate-for-street-children.jpg" alt="street children in India" class="wp-image-202"/></figure>



<p>Street children are not a rare sight in India. They are all around us and unfortunately, it has become normal to see them and not pay heed to their existence on the streets. Children are the future of every country as they lead the nation forward towards newer developments and heights of success. But millions of children in India are living on the streets and looking after themselves however they best can.</p>



<p>All children require necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. There are other integral resources too that help contributes to their development like healthcare facilities, participation in extra-curricular activities etc. Having responsible and caring adults around also helps provide them with a support system that is much-required during the initial impressionable years of children. The streets are harsh and deprived of such resources that further deteriorate their living conditions. Living in such extreme vulnerable conditions, that too, at such a young age, can be traumatising and that is why many children on the streets resort to drug abuse, violence etc.</p>



<p>The
fundamental requirement in the case of street children is the understanding of
their basic rights and provide them with those like basic education. Attending
school and receiving a quality education is essential for underprivileged
children. It not only helps them move past the vicious cycle of poverty and get
stable jobs in the future but also helps them grow up to be responsible and
driven individuals who strive for success.</p>



<p>This is where Salaam Baalak Trust comes into the picture as the well-known and reputed non-profit organisation has been working for the welfare of street children. SBT, based out of Delhi in India, focuses on <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescuing street children</a><strong> </strong>and help them rehabilitate and readjust in society. Many children are also helped in reuniting them with their families. Several children get separated from their families and SBT helps them find their homes.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a> and help them have a real chance at a prosperous future. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s efforts to ensure more children have access to basic education, medical support, healthy meals etc. Donate now to make a difference!</p>

<p>We all know about the existence of street children in India. Their presence is apparent to everyone yet most of us to choose to ignore them. It is a deplorable state of affairs to see how children, who require constant and an abundance of support, are deprived of basic resources and mentorship. They roam around the streets to fend for themselves. They may even be seen working odd jobs at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>, rag-picking at railway stations, shoe cleaning in busy streets, or even begging at temples and bus stands etc.</p>



<p>Many people try to&nbsp;rescue street children,&nbsp;temporarily, by giving them some money or a meal to eat. This is an act of kindness but one that is hardly part of the solution. Some people even think that employing poor children at their homes to do the domestic chores will help, when in fact, it is an act of engaging in child labour. This contributes to more harm than good and affects the psychological and physical well-being of the child.&nbsp;It is to be noted that no child must ever engage in any sort of labour. These impressionable years require for children to study, play with other children of their age group, participate in extra-curricular activities, watch informative visual content etc. Instead, rescuing&nbsp;abandoned street children&nbsp;becomes an even more distant dream when the plight of their street life is observed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many individuals, government agencies and non-profit organizations in India that are working hard to improve the struggles of street children and help provide them with short-term and/or long-term support. One of the NGOs that is known to offer generous support and a commendable platform to underprivileged children is Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi. This non-profit has been working in the respective field for more than 30 years and has protected many children by placing them in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter for street children</a>. The children are offered nutritious meals, a safe shelter, nurturing guardians, and playmates of their age for them to uplift the quality of their life. You can also help Salaam Baalak Trust in their endeavour to empower street children and ensure that they lead happier and healthier lives. So wait no more and join in to help more children lead a life without hardships and sufferings. Donate now!</p>

<p>Street children are a reality and their existence is a direct reflection on any country’s true development. There are millions of children living without adult supervision or support of any kind. Be it monetary, mental or emotional, there are no responsible and caring adults around them to provide them with resources or tools that may help in leading a happy childhood.</p>



<p>Safety is also another area where <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> face acute troubles. The streets are full of gangs, violence, extreme poverty, and zero accountability – these factors, when accumulated, create an extremely dangerous environment for any child. Many children are lured into joining gangs and are trained to eventually commit crimes, from petty jobs like pickpocketing to more elaborate and dangerous activities like prostitution, abduction, murder etc.</p>



<p>Children who live on the streets are deprived of their basic
rights like quality education, safe shelter, regular and nutritious meals etc.
Instead, they are surrounded by questionable characters on the streets who
nudge them or worse, compel them, to lead a life without morality and function
with suppressed emotions. This can be quite harmful to a child&#8217;s psyche. Many
children fall into such traps and start participating in self-serving plans,
without any accountability or guilt. This deteriorating pattern only gets worse
with time, and the crimes multiply into gruesome actions.</p>



<p>Such unsteady environments are not conducive for a healthy
childhood. This is why Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi, a reputed non profit
organization in India, rescues and restores street children with the respective
families, or at SBT’s Children’s Homes. All children are extended medical
facilities and engaged in extra-curricular activities like performing arts etc.</p>



<p>Independence Day, celebrated on the 15th of August, is an occasion that must be celebrated with much pride and fervour. Supporting NGO Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi to rescue street and working children from the shackles of street-life is a great way to commemorate the day. This year, you can celebrate the spirit of Independence Day by ensuring street children are protected and have equal opportunities like other children to build a promising future. Help Salaam Baalak Trust and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for children’s education</a>&nbsp;right away!</p>
