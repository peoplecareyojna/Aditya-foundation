<p>What do you mean by a powerful country? Is it their people, their financial resources, or their natural resources? Leaders all around the world would emphasise that a nation is made up of its people and their strengths. After all, it is true that a nation&#8217;s intellectual capacity is its most valuable asset. So, investing in nutrition is not a choice but rather a must, especially in the context of the future of any country &#8211; its children. </p>



<p>The sad reality is that we have failed to equip our population, our children, and our future leaders with the fundamental principles of nutrition. Many of us who live in cities are more concerned about choosing which cuisine to eat from all the options accessible to us than worrying about those who are experiencing physical pain due to starvation. There is a sizable portion of children who are barely hanging on and are fighting hunger at all times. They simply aim to consume any type of food to maintain their health and survive another day.</p>



<p>A complete plate of food is required for every child. To help disadvantaged children grow properly, especially those living on the streets, wholesome food is crucial. Daily protect them from ailments because they are full of the goodness of nutrients. Taking care of children and ensuring their healthy development as they grow up is one of the most crucial aspects of any form of development. The reality in India, however, is quite different. We have consistently failed to give our children the most basic care, including nutritious meals, which has led to their stunted growth and other nutritional issues.</p>



<p>Numerous students struggle with unrecognised hunger. You can help make a difference by donating to SBT, a reputable <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Indian NGO in Delhi NCR</a> that has been running child-centric programmes to help India’s children have a happier and healthier future. SBT offers a sensitive and nurturing atmosphere for street and working children. SBT aims to give children a place where they can realise their full potential and their rights to a secure environment, an education, and good health and nutrition. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for children</a> to ensure they have access to their birthright of daily meals!</p>

<p>We all strive to grow and thrive with the help of the many resources at our disposal. We desire the best in everything in our life, including relationships, good health, and successful careers. However, street children do not have the luxury to do so as they live with little or no resources. Their birthright of having access to a safe shelter, regular meals, education, and overall protection is not extended to them. Rather, children go through helplessness to make ends meet and many times, they end up getting involved in illegal activities like pickpocketing, prostitution, etc.</p>



<p>Street children are susceptible to innumerable uncertainties at every nook and corner on a daily basis. The dangers of being surrounded by aggressive adults in overwhelming and harsh environments, without any supervision, make them more prone to violence and abuse. This is one of the many reasons why children living on the streets frequently give in to drug use. Their mental health deteriorates due to daily beatings, working long hours for minimum wages, loneliness etc. Many children are runaways who have faced abuse in varied forms and try to escape that life, only to fall into a similar or worse trap of the unforgiving streets of India. This makes matters worse for their mental health with each passing year.</p>



<p>It is time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a>&nbsp;and give them a better life, one that is full of promise and opportunities. Several non-profit organisations are working hard to run child-centric programmes that improve the quality of life of children. Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed NGO that has been rescuing and rehabilitating street children. SBT provides full care and protection to street children and ensures they are well taken care of. For a few decades now, SBT has been providing shelter homes, educational opportunities, healthcare facilities, and healthy meals. Many of these underprivileged children have gone on to become successful artists, entrepreneurs, working professionals, social workers etc. They have been encouraged, supported, and championed to evolve and maximise their potential. Your donation to SBT, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi NCR</a>, shall support Salaam Baalak Trust’s tireless work to protect children in need. So wait no more and support now!</p>
