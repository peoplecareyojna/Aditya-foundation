<p>Many children in India are victims of child labour, child trafficking, and child abuse. There are many atrocities that they face due to unsupervised living and in the company of shady characters that are looking after their vested interests. All children require responsible and helpful mentors to help guide them through troubles, life lessons, and other learning experiences. </p>



<p>The impact of abuse of any sort can leave a long-lasting imprint on the psyche of children. It can have severe and unexpected effects on the personality of the children as well. Without love and care, children feel lost and have a difficult time dealing with the many changes around them, and such horrific incidents can hamper their development in many ways.</p>



<p>Many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>&nbsp;end up resorting to drugs to handle the pressure of dealing with abuse while others join gangs or the company of untoward people on the streets to feel somewhat safe and protected. In reality, they are anything but safe as they often begin participating in illegal activities like selling drugs, pick-pocketing etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positive and productive environment, proper infrastructure, and generous care are basic needs for underprivileged children who have lived on the streets. They also require basic education, healthcare facilities, safe shelter, and responsible adults around them to support and encourage them. Extra-curricular activities are also essential to help nurture children and give them the platform to express themselves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organization in India, works relentlessly to provide all of the aforementioned facilities at the SBT shelter homes for boys and girls. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working in the area of children’s welfare for the last several decades. They have rescued and rehabilitated several children and even reunited many of them with their families. Such efforts have improved the lives of many children and given a new lease to them where they have grown up to have successful careers. You can also support SBT’s programs and support underprivileged children by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and also availing a 50% tax deduction under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.

<p>Street children are a reality and their existence is a direct reflection on any country’s true development. There are millions of children living without adult supervision or support of any kind. Be it monetary, mental or emotional, there are no responsible and caring adults around them to provide them with resources or tools that may help in leading a happy childhood.</p>



<p>Safety is also another area where <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> face acute troubles. The streets are full of gangs, violence, extreme poverty, and zero accountability – these factors, when accumulated, create an extremely dangerous environment for any child. Many children are lured into joining gangs and are trained to eventually commit crimes, from petty jobs like pickpocketing to more elaborate and dangerous activities like prostitution, abduction, murder etc.</p>



<p>Children who live on the streets are deprived of their basic
rights like quality education, safe shelter, regular and nutritious meals etc.
Instead, they are surrounded by questionable characters on the streets who
nudge them or worse, compel them, to lead a life without morality and function
with suppressed emotions. This can be quite harmful to a child&#8217;s psyche. Many
children fall into such traps and start participating in self-serving plans,
without any accountability or guilt. This deteriorating pattern only gets worse
with time, and the crimes multiply into gruesome actions.</p>



<p>Such unsteady environments are not conducive for a healthy
childhood. This is why Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi, a reputed non profit
organization in India, rescues and restores street children with the respective
families, or at SBT’s Children’s Homes. All children are extended medical
facilities and engaged in extra-curricular activities like performing arts etc.</p>



<p>Independence Day, celebrated on the 15th of August, is an occasion that must be celebrated with much pride and fervour. Supporting NGO Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi to rescue street and working children from the shackles of street-life is a great way to commemorate the day. This year, you can celebrate the spirit of Independence Day by ensuring street children are protected and have equal opportunities like other children to build a promising future. Help Salaam Baalak Trust and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for children’s education</a>&nbsp;right away!</p>

<p>There are millions of street children in India &#8211; unfortunately, the number has only spiked in the last decade. There are many reasons why children become runaways, hawkers, thieves, work odd jobs, or do absolutely nothing in life &#8211; nothing productive anyway.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> spend their lives on the streets of big market areas amid all of the hustle-bustle, or throw away their nights and days on railway stations. A lot many homeless children can also be found loitering or begging on the steps of places of worship (mosques, temples, Gurudwaras etc) or making themselves invisible in busy areas of bus depots or abandoned areas under bridges, behind massive parking lots etc. The life of a child living on the street is one full of dread. Unspeakable living conditions, minimal nutrition, and barely able to keep themselves safe (mentally, physical or emotionally) is what a young child goes through on a daily basis. To understand the situation better, it is integral to know the types that are included under the term ‘street child’.</p>
<p>There are mainly three broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Children that live with their families on the street &#8211; These children are more commonly under the category of ‘working children’ as well, often as added help to their families to meet the minimum needs of the family.</li>
<li>Children that have remote interaction with their families &#8211; They usually live on their own (could also be part of other groups of street children). Their economic survival is usually negligible.</li>
<li>Children that have absolutely no connection with their families &#8211; These children are usually runaways or orphans, and are more vulnerable to abuse and extremely inhuman living conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several reasons as to why street children live in such life-threatening conditions &#8211; one of the main being poverty, abuse, lack of adult guidance, lack of education etc, thus making the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/projects.php">rescue of abandoned children</a> even more integral and urgent.</p>
<p>Salaam Baalak Trust came into existence to help street and working children restore their lives and lead respectable, safe and happy lives ahead. The non profit organisation has been dedicated towards helping disadvantaged children lead purposeful lives, where they are included into the society with open arms, devoid of judgement or malice.</p>
<p>SBT has been running several programs that include the rescue of street children, and successfully reuniting them with their families in many cases. If you don’t want to turn a blind eye any further, and want to ensure that no more children roam aimlessly and anxiously on the streets of our country, reach out to Salaam Baalak Trust at <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/</a> and join their efforts.</p>
