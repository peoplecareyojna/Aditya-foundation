<p>Street children face an overwhelming struggle where they have to navigate a world filled with dangers and uncertainties. For these vulnerable children, who are constantly at risk, a safe shelter isn&#8217;t just a physical space; it represents a sanctuary where their basic needs are met and where they find refuge from the harsh realities of life on the streets. Providing secure shelters equipped with integral resources and aid is imperative to protecting and nurturing these children.</p>



<p>These shelters must offer more
than just a roof overhead. They should serve as holistic havens, providing
access to education, healthcare, psychological support, and life skills
training. Education stands as a beacon of hope, empowering these children with
the knowledge and skills necessary for a better future. Integrating healthcare
facilities ensures their physical well-being, addressing ailments resulting
from their impoverished living conditions and often risky lifestyles.</p>



<p>Moreover, psychological support
is crucial, as many <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street
children in India</a> have experienced trauma or abuse and need guidance to
heal and thrive. Equipping them with life skills like vocational training or
basic financial literacy fosters their independence, allowing them to break
free from the cycle of poverty.</p>



<p>Integral to these shelters is a
nurturing environment where caretakers offer mentorship, guidance, and
emotional support. Creating a sense of community and belonging helps rebuild
the shattered trust and confidence of these children, giving them a sense of
purpose and self-worth.</p>



<p>Collaboration between
governments, NGOs, and communities is paramount in establishing and maintaining
such shelters. Adequate funding, resources, and trained staff are essential for
their sustainability. Raising awareness about the plight of street children and
garnering support from society can drive initiatives aimed at providing safe
shelters.</p>



<p>By offering these children a safe
shelter along with essential resources, we not only protect them from the
difficulties of the streets but also invest in shaping a brighter future. It&#8217;s
the collective responsibility of every nation and society to ensure that every
child, regardless of their circumstances, is granted the opportunity to grow up
in a secure and nurturing environment, fostering their potential and
contributing positively to society.

Salaam Baalak Trust is dedicated to protecting
and supporting street children in India, providing safe shelters, education,
and healthcare resources. Your support can transform lives, offering these
vulnerable children a chance at a brighter future. Donate today to Salaam
Baalak Trust and help <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">educate
street children</a>, offering them a secure haven and essential resources they
need to thrive.

<p>National Education Day is an occasion that commemorates the need for all children to be educated. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/inclusion-through-education.php">education for street children</a> is still not a reality in most parts of India. The number of children living on the streets and working hard to survive has been steadily rising. Education is not even on their radar amidst the struggle to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Innumerable underprivileged children wind up on the streets for a variety of reasons. Many of them travel to Delhi from their impoverished backgrounds in search of chances and a better life. Some run away from their homes due to abusive and careless guardians, while others have been reported to be cut off from their relatives and are unable to contact them again. The suffering of these children as they struggle on the unpredictable streets of India is a wake-up call for the entire nation.</p>



<p>Presently, children can be seen doing varied random activities on the streets, be it selling knick-knacks at traffic signals, begging, picking up trash, or worse, engaging in illegal activities. This is not the life fit for anyone &#8211; definitely not for children.</p>



<p>A Tough Life<br>The problems that Delhi&#8217;s street children face are numerous. Children not only endure a rough life that is frequently dangerous and without shelter, but they also have to deal with violence and brutality. Adults abuse young children, compel them to work, beg, and commit crimes. They are also verbally, physically, and emotionally abused. There have been reports of abuse and violence against more than half of the population of street children, and so much of it still goes unreported. The majority of children lack ID cards or other documents that would allow them to participate in government programmes that supply essentials to minors. The world&#8217;s greatest concentration of street children is thought to be in India.</p>



<p>Protection and Rehabilitation<br>Numerous NGOs have been extending support in many forms to support street children. One such NGO that has dedicated years of effort to the well-being of India&#8217;s street children is Salaam Baalak Trust. SBT offers food, clothing, healthcare, education, and most importantly, love and care. This National Education Day, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for children&#8217;s education</a> to help give them a promising future, one that enables them to pursue their dreams and eventually have a job to pay their bills. Let’s give a better life to them!</p>

<p>Children in our country hold the key to a developed country with a bright future. However, not all of them receive the treatment they merit. Unfortunately, our country&#8217;s street children suffer the most from the economic downturn, shoddy infrastructure, and crumbling system. To ensure that they develop into better citizens of the country, it is crucial to give them all of your attention and goodness. <br><br>Innumerable children who end up on the streets have actually run away from home. They flee because they frequently strive to avoid domestic abuse and even early marriages. When they move to a new city or area, they frequently accept low-paying employment and often resort to begging. These children experience physical, mental, and even sexual abuse in such situations. Therefore, it is crucial to protect them from such horrors.&nbsp;<br><br>Numerous NGOs are working to provide street children with the best lives they can have – but it is a herculean task that requires all the support possible, and then some. Salaam Baalak Trust is one of the most respected and trusted organisations, dedicated to helping street children. The NGO, based in New Delhi, has been fervently carrying out child-centric programmes to help make a real difference in the lives of street and working children. SBT provides them with education, clothing, healthcare, and shelter. Most importantly, the non-profit organisation provides love, care, and protection – something they have almost never experienced. &nbsp;The improvement in children&#8217;s life is the major goal – for a wholesome childhood and a promising future. </p>



<p>SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues street children</a>&nbsp;and improves their quality of life through collective and constant efforts. And you can also help by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and contribute towards their well-being. In addition to a generous contribution, you can volunteer at SBT too. This may include activities like Yoga, dance, music, and more. Volunteers from India and the world look forward to their time volunteering at SBT and going back home with priceless experiences. Donate for the welfare of street children and ensure they are protected from the harsh and unforgiving streets of India. Support now!</p>

<p><br>India has a large population of street children. Using India&#8217;s massive rail system, children run away from their homes to escape abuse, violence, and poverty. They travel to big cities in the hopes of leaving that overwhelmingly difficult life behind, only to find themselves in the underbelly of the streets, alone and deprived. When thousands of children arrive at India&#8217;s enormous and crowded train stations, they are disoriented, afraid, and alone, with no idea what to do. They are forced to live on the platforms after having their ambitions ruthlessly crushed. This is happening with innumerable children on a daily basis.</p>



<p>For several troublesome reasons, children flee their homes or are compelled to do so. Many people desire a better future and the chance to work in urban areas. But without any resources at all, they are neither able to survive on the streets nor reunite with their families.</p>



<p>Abusers looking to take advantage of vulnerable and lonely children roam around in the hopes of finding these children to make them their prey for vested interests. They either exploit them by engaging the children in child labour or other forms of child trafficking, or other illegal activities like robbery, prostitution etc. This also compels many children to turn to substance misuse to handle their mental health and many other difficulties but addiction only makes matters worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s well-known&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a>, has been working hard to help rescue and rehabilitate underprivileged children. SBT has been running multiple shelter homes to ensure children have access to food, shelter, safety, and assistance. SBT has been working hard for their welfare for over 30 years. It is time to protect more children and prevent them from being ignored or abused, and that is why SBT runs varied child-centric programmes besides its education programmes for children. The activities include mental health support, performing arts workshops, sports practices etc. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a>&nbsp;to help make a difference and gift a better and more promising future to these forgotten children.</p>

<p>India is a wonderful country with many developments and milestones that have been acknowledged on the world stage. People in India are generous too, helping those in need. Donations are integral for the non-profit organisations that have been working to protect underprivileged communities. Many people, especially <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children in India</a>, are still living without any of the basic resources. Children on the streets struggle to find food, shelter, education, safety, or protection. They constantly live in a vulnerable environment, deprived of support or improvement in any area of their lives.</p>



<p>Donating for the welfare of children can bring
quite a change in their lives. Children can get the opportunity to live without
fear or insecurities. They can also have a productive and positive childhood
that most street children never get to experience. Many working children engage
in child labour where they work odd jobs to earn a basic wage to survive
somehow. Many children fall into the trap of drug abuse, prostitution, violence
etc that does a lot of harm to them – mentally, physically, and psychologically
too.</p>



<p>Generous contributions to an NGO can help run child-centric programs to rescue and rehabilitate children and give them a life where they grow up to be in white-collar jobs – without the fear of poverty or illiteracy. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working towards the welfare of children for over 30 years. The NGO is known for its varied programs that help build better lives for street children. Donors can support Salaam Baalak Trust and even save tax on their donations. A monthly or one-time donation can help underprivileged children in more ways than one. SBT runs varied boys and girls residential homes across Delhi/NCR. A birthday donation or any other special occasion donation can also help in providing necessities to children under SBT’s care. It is time to help make a difference and ensure children have a real chance at a promising future.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-1024x536.jpg" alt="Diwali Celebration at SBT" class="wp-image-252" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-design.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Diwali is here &#8211; the wonderful festival of lights that brings prosperity and joy into our lives. But this is not the case for street children. Millions of children go to work every day to earn daily wages. This is their reality of street children and the reason behind their deteriorating health &#8211; mental, physical and emotional. Countless children from all walks of life in India spend their childhood working hard to earn any basic wages to have access to some resources to survive. Instead of enjoying the joys of these early growth periods, they work long hours and are involved in tedious chores. Child labour has become the norm for most people where they don&#8217;t bat an eye when children beg on the streets or work at a roadside stall or as domestic help etc. Children can even be seen washing dishes behind the restaurant, sitting at paan shops, or shining shoes on many busy streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason for their participation in multiple areas of work is because they have no other option to survive. Most underprivileged children are orphans and live in abject poverty. Many are also abandoned while others work to help contribute to their family’s minimum income. Many children run away from home; these street children do not have any guardians or other resources to guide them on the right path to a healthy childhood.</p>



<p>There are many dangerous places such as different types of factories etc where children can be found working in extreme heat or bitter cold. They participate in dangerous activities to earn less than the minimum wage, even at the expense of their health. Children can be seen working at factories that produce clothing, crackers, tobacco, biscuits, etc, and many other unstructured businesses that employ young children to work for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Child labour keeps children away from playing with other children which is extremely harmful to a child during their impressionable years. This greatly affects their psychological and social development. Through proper playtime activities, children learn to cultivate friendship and nurture positive connections with others which helps them become confident, compassionate and caring people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the true essence of Diwali, an auspicious occasion, you can donate to Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has been working for the welfare of street children for over 30 years. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">Donate for children&#8217;s medical aid</a> and help SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescue abandoned children</a>.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-1024x683.jpg" alt="World Mental Health Day" class="wp-image-246" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Children on the streets have a tough time living a life of distress and deprivation. They are also going through a lot of uncertainty and more often than not, that ends up affecting their mental well-being. This is because street life can be extremely distressing to a child’s impressionable mind.</p>



<p>This is the age when children need to be well looked after. Instead, they have to live without any basic necessities and make several life choices on a daily basis. These integral resources include a safe shelter, quality healthcare services, hot and nutritious meals, regular education etc. But the reality is far from this, as we know. Children have to fend for themselves and typically, they end up getting stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty, illiteracy, child labour, and other forms of exploitation etc.</p>



<p>Mental health is an essential topic in the case of underprivileged children and must be addressed. There are many areas of concern when it comes to the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health of street children</a>. They may go through depression, substance abuse, anxiety, sleeplessness etc. After all, surviving on your own from a tender age can be a severely disturbing issue for a child. This is why regular medical check-ups must be conducted to ensure no mental health issue is overlooked as that may worsen the situation.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children also require proper medical support and Salaam Baalak Trust has been working relentlessly to rescue and <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/restoration.php">rehabilitate street children</a>. The non-profit organisation also ensures that there are proper records of children’s medical history of diseases, check-ups and treatments to ensure they receive the best of medical support. Regular health camps are also conducted for the children to spread awareness on the importance of good health and ensure that children’s health is not neglected anymore.</p>



<p>10th October
is commemorated as World Mental Health Day. You can generously donate for
children and ensure they are provided with proper medical support, safety and
protection, to ensure they have a positive and promising future. Join hands
with Salaam Balaak Trust and gift children a better childhood!</p>

<p>Street children found on the streets is a norm in India. Millions of children live on the streets, without any basic resources. This has become a sight that everyone has gotten used to which, unfortunately, does not make one cringe. But this could not be worse for society and India’s development, besides the negative impact it has on the lives of those children. After all, the condition of the youth defines where the country is heading. Children without any guardians or support system to guide them through childhood, puberty and eventually adulthood are horrifying; these impressionable years much be acknowledged and worked upon with the respective child.</p>



<p>In the case of street children, most of them are runaways who
were desperate to escape the situation at home – it could be due to poverty,
abuse, exploitation, lack of love and care etc. The situation on the streets is
no better of course but it is too late for the child to realise as they are
already living on the streets by then. They have no money for basic utilities,
no shelter for protection, and no access to meals or a group of people to
depend on.</p>



<p>The reason why street children are considered as one of the most
vulnerable groups in India (UNICEF) is that they are susceptible to all sorts
of abuse &#8211; child labour, sexual abuse (prostitution, child trafficking etc),
child marriage, illiteracy etc.</p>



<p>The health of underprivileged children also gets quite compromised as they do not have access to regular vaccinations, integral immunizations etc. They are also deprived of quality healthcare, especially mental health programs which are much needed as many street children fall into the traps of hard drugs, depression and other forms of self-harm. Many of them are unable to communicate with other people or exhibit social skills of any sort. Lack of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health programs for street children</a><strong> </strong>can prove to be more harmful, affect their personal growth and decrease their chances of having a safe and supportive community.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to children’s education</a>​ and support Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has empowered thousands of street children. Donate now!</p>

Instead of being an obvious requirement, many children on the streets struggle with everyday battles like protecting themselves, find scraps to eat and making ends meet to have a shelter etc. Surviving on the harsh streets can be overwhelming for a child and what makes matters worse is that they are deprived of mentors or any responsible adults around them who can help guide them.</p>



<p>This is why many children fall under the trap
of illegal activities and end up engaging with the wrong company. Several
trafficked children follow the lead of those that rob, cheat, or encourage the
children to protect themselves by harming others. Such actions affect children
for the long run where they become even more clueless about their actions and
the repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many children also face mental health issues
due to drug abuse, physical or sexual abuse, violence, abandonment, and trauma
of many types. From sleepless nights to anger issues, from addiction to lack of
social skills, underprivileged children face many tough situations that their
impressionable mind and gentle spirit is unable to process. This is why street
children need all the more positive reinforcement and constant support system
to help them recover and revive from the experiences of the underbelly of the
streets.</p>

non-profit organisations, works hard to give a promising future to children in
