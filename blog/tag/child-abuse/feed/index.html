<p>Republic Day is commemorated on 26th January. This is an integral occasion for all Indians as it is the day when the nation marched towards democracy and the Declaration of Indian Independence was issued. The country has had many milestones since then and varied developments have been quite fruitful in the global context. The children of India who live on the streets still have a long way to go. Unfortunately, they continue to live a life of deprivation where they long for safety and protection.</p>



<p>India is a strong nation with many possibilities and opportunities extended to its people across the globe. Underprivileged children, however, have a hard time living without basic resources. They are deprived of all basic resources, including shelter, food, education etc. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> have a hard time living in unpredictable and overwhelming environments that affect them in more ways than one – physically as well as psychologically.Many children end up working at varied places to find odd jobs, thus engaging in child labour. Child abuse is another awful practice that several children become a part of – be it due to prostitution, gangs and other harmful practices.</p>



<p>It is time
children receive love and care, as well as access to healthcare resources etc
to be able to have a healthy and productive childhood. Children must be able to
play with other children, experience joy and jubilation, and have a prosperous
future, devoid of negativity and hostility.</p>



<p>This
Republic Day, let’s pledge to be more forthcoming towards the welfare of street
children. They must also be seen, heard and welcomed as an integral part of
society. Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most respected and trusted non-profit
organisations in India, has been working diligently towards the betterment of
street and working children. SBT has set up many Children’s Homes to ensure
children receive resources that help them in learning and growing properly.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for the children</a> of India and protect their future. After all, a country’s growth is directly related to the opportunities and resources its children have. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s programs and extend better and wholesome living conditions for children. Donate now!</p>

<p>We all know about the existence of street children in India. Their presence is apparent to everyone yet most of us to choose to ignore them. It is a deplorable state of affairs to see how children, who require constant and an abundance of support, are deprived of basic resources and mentorship. They roam around the streets to fend for themselves. They may even be seen working odd jobs at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>, rag-picking at railway stations, shoe cleaning in busy streets, or even begging at temples and bus stands etc.</p>



<p>Many people try to&nbsp;rescue street children,&nbsp;temporarily, by giving them some money or a meal to eat. This is an act of kindness but one that is hardly part of the solution. Some people even think that employing poor children at their homes to do the domestic chores will help, when in fact, it is an act of engaging in child labour. This contributes to more harm than good and affects the psychological and physical well-being of the child.&nbsp;It is to be noted that no child must ever engage in any sort of labour. These impressionable years require for children to study, play with other children of their age group, participate in extra-curricular activities, watch informative visual content etc. Instead, rescuing&nbsp;abandoned street children&nbsp;becomes an even more distant dream when the plight of their street life is observed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many individuals, government agencies and non-profit organizations in India that are working hard to improve the struggles of street children and help provide them with short-term and/or long-term support. One of the NGOs that is known to offer generous support and a commendable platform to underprivileged children is Salaam Baalak Trust Delhi. This non-profit has been working in the respective field for more than 30 years and has protected many children by placing them in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter for street children</a>. The children are offered nutritious meals, a safe shelter, nurturing guardians, and playmates of their age for them to uplift the quality of their life. You can also help Salaam Baalak Trust in their endeavour to empower street children and ensure that they lead happier and healthier lives. So wait no more and join in to help more children lead a life without hardships and sufferings. Donate now!</p>

<p>Street children often take up innumerable jobs to make ends meet. In order to survive in the harsh conditions of the streets, children ought to fend for themselves, to be able to provide bare minimum utilities for themselves, like food, clothing, shelter. Even though most children make-do with the basics, or often barely so, they engage in odd jobs to survive on the streets. Street children face a lot many hurdles to work for a basic wage &#8211; they can often take everyday-odd jobs or work regularly at a place that is quite hazardous to them &#8211; mentally, physically, and even emotionally. Following are some of the jobs that working children engage in for basic survival.</p>



<p>Laborers<br>Children work in factories that are horribly unsafe, unhealthy and underpaid. From working in factories that moves coal and makes crackers to garment warehouses and restaurants, children can be seen working for long hours and in extreme weather conditions. They constantly experience burnout.</p>



<p>Rag-Picking<br>This is a common sight in India &#8211; children can be seen with gunny bags that help them carry any number of things &#8211; from plastic bottles to paper and tin. Anything that can be recycled or even used at their temporary place of stay is picked up by these children. They can also be found near dustbins and other dumping grounds picking material. </p>



<p>Odd Jobs<br>Many children are involved in occupations that are temporary and that offer day-to-day earnings. From messenger-boys to cleaners, peddlers and even petty-hawkers, children are often involved in irregular tasks.</p>



<p>Porters<br>One may often come across street children working at wholesale markets, railway stations, bus stands, and even godowns. Children carry varied weights of material and have to often pull or push them to short or even long distances. </p>



<p>If you have come across <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> carrying out any of the above tasks, or even know about how children in India are living in such dire circumstances, then take the plunge to help Salaam Baalak Trust. The non-profit organization works for street and working children to empower them with education, safe shelter and performing arts. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a> right away.</p>

<p>There are millions of street children in India &#8211; unfortunately, the number has only spiked in the last decade. There are many reasons why children become runaways, hawkers, thieves, work odd jobs, or do absolutely nothing in life &#8211; nothing productive anyway.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> spend their lives on the streets of big market areas amid all of the hustle-bustle, or throw away their nights and days on railway stations. A lot many homeless children can also be found loitering or begging on the steps of places of worship (mosques, temples, Gurudwaras etc) or making themselves invisible in busy areas of bus depots or abandoned areas under bridges, behind massive parking lots etc. The life of a child living on the street is one full of dread. Unspeakable living conditions, minimal nutrition, and barely able to keep themselves safe (mentally, physical or emotionally) is what a young child goes through on a daily basis. To understand the situation better, it is integral to know the types that are included under the term ‘street child’.</p>
<p>There are mainly three broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Children that live with their families on the street &#8211; These children are more commonly under the category of ‘working children’ as well, often as added help to their families to meet the minimum needs of the family.</li>
<li>Children that have remote interaction with their families &#8211; They usually live on their own (could also be part of other groups of street children). Their economic survival is usually negligible.</li>
<li>Children that have absolutely no connection with their families &#8211; These children are usually runaways or orphans, and are more vulnerable to abuse and extremely inhuman living conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several reasons as to why street children live in such life-threatening conditions &#8211; one of the main being poverty, abuse, lack of adult guidance, lack of education etc, thus making the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/projects.php">rescue of abandoned children</a> even more integral and urgent.</p>
<p>Salaam Baalak Trust came into existence to help street and working children restore their lives and lead respectable, safe and happy lives ahead. The non profit organisation has been dedicated towards helping disadvantaged children lead purposeful lives, where they are included into the society with open arms, devoid of judgement or malice.</p>
<p>SBT has been running several programs that include the rescue of street children, and successfully reuniting them with their families in many cases. If you don’t want to turn a blind eye any further, and want to ensure that no more children roam aimlessly and anxiously on the streets of our country, reach out to Salaam Baalak Trust at <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/</a> and join their efforts.</p>
