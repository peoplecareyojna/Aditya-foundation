<p>The first wave of COVID-19 was extremely tough for the world, including India. People across the country were battling with the many repercussions of the pandemic – be it the effects of the lockdown, loss of jobs, lack of integral resources etc.</p>



<p>The situation seemed to get a tad better but it only worsened as the second wave hit India. The grave situation has brought about a lot of struggle, especially for the COVID-affected patients and their families. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a> are one of the worst-hit communities in India during these troubled times. Millions of children live on the streets where they fend for themselves and works towards finding basic meals, a safe shelter, medical resources, regular education etc. In these difficult times, such resources are even harder to access.</p>



<p>Besides these utilities, underprivileged children and their
families are not finding healthcare facilities or other everyday essentials
that are much-needed during these tough months.</p>



<p>Below are some of the requirements that can help improve the
situation a bit for underprivileged communities:</p>



<p>Awareness sessions are much required as sensitisation can help
bust the many myths surrounding COVID-19, its effects, and the aftermath. Such
sessions will also help the community members understand how to protect
themselves and take necessary safety precautions. The drives will help guide
people who are unaware of the essential steps to take once someone in their family
is infected – they must know how to manage the illness at home and ensure it is
not spread further.</p>



<p>Providing ration and medical kits to families is a must! From
medicines to an oxygen supply, from hospital beds to mid-day meals, children
are in urgent need of such resources that must be accessible to them.</p>



<p>There are innumerable street and working children who are
ignored, abused, and severely affected by the second wave of the pandemic.
Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most trusted non-profit organisations in India,
is working every day to help ensure that children are protected and lead a life
of dignity and care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate
for children’s medical aid</a>
and other support right away!</p>

<p>Across the country, many children face daily struggles due to the harsh life on the streets. Millions of children in India are experiencing abuse, exploitation, hunger, and exclusion. The basic rights of children are also not extended to them – this includes the right to safety and protection, right to clean water, right to regular and healthy meals, right education, right to safe shelter, and the right to access to healthcare facilities.</p>



<p>The rights of children cannot be ignored and to ensure the same,
April 12th is marked as International Day for Street Children. This day is
commemorated to ensure that the condition of street children is brought to the
forefront and their plight is given a platform to address. It is high time
underprivileged children have a collective support system to help them step out
of the vicious cycle. The patterns of abuse, exploitation, illiteracy, and
poverty lead to many other long-term repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fundamental and constructive change is the need of the hour as
several children can still be seen begging at traffic signals, engaging in
labour work and other menial jobs to make ends meet somehow, or becoming a
ragpicker. Be it as domestic help or joining street gangs, children do anything
to survive as there is no mentoring or support system in place to guide them
through their impressionable years.</p>



<p>The International Day of Street Children is important as it helps raise much-needed awareness on the plight of the street and working children who have been discriminated against for far too long. This is where Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s reputed non-profit organisation, has been diligently working on for more than 30 years. SBT provides all of the integral resources for street and working children and also <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues abandoned children</a>. SBT offers full care and protection to the children and ensures that they have access to health and nutrition, mental health, and quality education. The children are placed in various Children’s Homes and also enrolled in vocational training programs to help them build their personalities and expand their minds. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php"> </a></strong>and celebrate the true spirit of International Day for Street Children.

<p>Many children in India are victims of child labour, child trafficking, and child abuse. There are many atrocities that they face due to unsupervised living and in the company of shady characters that are looking after their vested interests. All children require responsible and helpful mentors to help guide them through troubles, life lessons, and other learning experiences. </p>



<p>The impact of abuse of any sort can leave a long-lasting imprint on the psyche of children. It can have severe and unexpected effects on the personality of the children as well. Without love and care, children feel lost and have a difficult time dealing with the many changes around them, and such horrific incidents can hamper their development in many ways.</p>



<p>Many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>&nbsp;end up resorting to drugs to handle the pressure of dealing with abuse while others join gangs or the company of untoward people on the streets to feel somewhat safe and protected. In reality, they are anything but safe as they often begin participating in illegal activities like selling drugs, pick-pocketing etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positive and productive environment, proper infrastructure, and generous care are basic needs for underprivileged children who have lived on the streets. They also require basic education, healthcare facilities, safe shelter, and responsible adults around them to support and encourage them. Extra-curricular activities are also essential to help nurture children and give them the platform to express themselves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organization in India, works relentlessly to provide all of the aforementioned facilities at the SBT shelter homes for boys and girls. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working in the area of children’s welfare for the last several decades. They have rescued and rehabilitated several children and even reunited many of them with their families. Such efforts have improved the lives of many children and given a new lease to them where they have grown up to have successful careers. You can also support SBT’s programs and support underprivileged children by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and also availing a 50% tax deduction under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/donate-for-street-children.jpg" alt="street children in India" class="wp-image-202"/></figure>



<p>Street children are not a rare sight in India. They are all around us and unfortunately, it has become normal to see them and not pay heed to their existence on the streets. Children are the future of every country as they lead the nation forward towards newer developments and heights of success. But millions of children in India are living on the streets and looking after themselves however they best can.</p>



<p>All children require necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. There are other integral resources too that help contributes to their development like healthcare facilities, participation in extra-curricular activities etc. Having responsible and caring adults around also helps provide them with a support system that is much-required during the initial impressionable years of children. The streets are harsh and deprived of such resources that further deteriorate their living conditions. Living in such extreme vulnerable conditions, that too, at such a young age, can be traumatising and that is why many children on the streets resort to drug abuse, violence etc.</p>



<p>The
fundamental requirement in the case of street children is the understanding of
their basic rights and provide them with those like basic education. Attending
school and receiving a quality education is essential for underprivileged
children. It not only helps them move past the vicious cycle of poverty and get
stable jobs in the future but also helps them grow up to be responsible and
driven individuals who strive for success.</p>



<p>This is where Salaam Baalak Trust comes into the picture as the well-known and reputed non-profit organisation has been working for the welfare of street children. SBT, based out of Delhi in India, focuses on <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescuing street children</a><strong> </strong>and help them rehabilitate and readjust in society. Many children are also helped in reuniting them with their families. Several children get separated from their families and SBT helps them find their homes.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a> and help them have a real chance at a prosperous future. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s efforts to ensure more children have access to basic education, medical support, healthy meals etc. Donate now to make a difference!</p>

<p>There millions of children living on the streets of India. This is a harsh reality that must be improved for the betterment of the youth. The tumultuous surroundings of street children are daunting and unpredictable. Children are surrounded by adversity and shortage of all resources. Be it a safe shelter, basic education, medical facilities, or mentoring, street children do not have access to any of these essential tools to lead a happy, healthy, and productive childhood. Instead, the dark underbelly of India’s streets offers negative experiences like abuse, exploitation, violence, and depravity.</p>



<p>Street children run away from their homes due to varied reasons
revolving around discouraging circumstances but they end up in even worse
situations. Many children end up participating in child labour to survive on
the streets alone. The hours are long and the wages are the bare minimum,
besides the toll it takes on their mental and physical well-being. Several
hazardous conditions can also be found in factories where children are employed
which may have immediate as well as a long-term negative effect on them. Many
underprivileged children work as domestic help too, and what makes it worse is
that it is socially acceptable in many homes.</p>



<p>In an effort to survive on the rough streets, many children end
up engaging in illegal activities which only worsen their condition. Many
children take hard drugs too and the dependency on such chemicals makes them even
more susceptible to “do whatever it takes” for the next hit. Several children
on the streets are prone to drug abuse which is rather unfortunate as it
steadily dwindles their opportunities of a brighter and healthier future.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">Rescuing street children </a>is integral as they are the future of India. Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed non-profit organisation that provides a sensitive and caring environment for street and working children. The efforts of SBT help provide a platform for children to realize their full potential, offer them their right to a safe and secure space, and give access to education, health and nutrition.

<p>Mental health is getting more attention in the mainstream media in recent years – a welcome change as it signals that more people are becoming aware of the causes and impact of mental health. Innumerable people suffer silently and fight on their own, without any professional help or the support of their family and/or friends.</p>



<p>The situation is even worse for street children in India, one of
the most vulnerable groups that are often given little or no attention.
Children living on the streets and working children (engaged in child labour)
live in an environment that is not conducive for their growth.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Street children (opens in a new tab)">Street children</a> live in high-stress surroundings, constantly looking for basic utilities like food, shelter, clothing, and even a support system to depend on. Many of the rescued street children are known to experience anxiety, sleeplessness, anger and trust issues, and even end up having dependency issues due to substance abuse. Many children face domestic abuse at home and run away from their homes to search for a better environment while other children face varied types of abuse (mental, physical, emotional) on the streets – all of these leave a deep and long-lasting impact on the psyche that must be addressed and resolved. Children are quite impressionable during their formative years and require gentle and protective mentors around them to guide them through these early phases.</p>



<p>To help children have a hopeful and positive future, Salaam
Baalak Trust, one of the top NGOs in India, rescues and rehabilitates children
at their centres. They are provided with immense support, care, and essential
resources (medical facilities, access to extra-curricular activities etc) to
help them build a prosperous future. Several children who get lost or are
separated from their families are also reconnected if possible, and get a
second chance to a happier childhood.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Help-Children-Utilize-Time-At-Home-During-COVID-19.jpg" alt="Utilize Time At Home During COVID-19" class="wp-image-132"/></figure>



<p>The world is currently facing a tough time due to the outbreak of COVID-19, also known as ‘coronavirus’. There is a lockdown in most countries and people are required to stay indoors and keep all physical contacts to a bare minimum. The pandemic has compelled the governments of most countries to urge people to follow these rules for their well-being and take preventive measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Several people have been digitally sharing their experiences regarding staying indoors, including India where the government recently implemented a 21-day lockdown across the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children, in particular, have been quite affected by the
disruption in their everyday schedule and the changing environment. Especially
at that age, most children are quite aware that there is an undercurrent of
discomfort among the adults and a change in their overall lifestyle. The
schools are also closed and children are not allowed to go out to play or
engage with their friends and classmates. This has surely left them with a lot
of free time at home and making a lot of children feel restless and anxious.
The parents must address these issues head-on instead of tip-toeing around the
situation. Children must be updated about why there is a sudden regulation in
the house, obviously according to the age and understanding of the respective
child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important thing to remember for parents is to make the most
of this time and carry out productive activities in the house to keep a check
on the adrenaline levels of the children. Read on to know about some ways to
bring down the stress levels at home and help children during these unforeseen
times.</p>



<p>Plan a Schedule<br>Children naturally feel more at ease when there is a schedule in place as it keeps them busy and tackles with any boredom that might creep in during a lockdown. A daily routine for learning, playtime, DIY activities, reading hour and quizzes etc shall make for a wholesome day.</p>



<p>Emotionally Strong<br>Children are quite receptive to their surroundings. That is why it is important to balance their emotional levels by spreading more positive and healthy energies in the house. Spending quality family time and reconnecting with relatives online, and ensuring the grandparents are connected with the child, be it at home or digitally, is a great way to keep up their spirits.  </p>



<p>There are several underprivileged children on the streets who are getting affected the most as they continue to be deprived of basic resources like food, clothing and shelter. Salaam Baalak Trust, a non profit organization in New Delhi works towards providing a safe shelter, healthy meals, and quality education. Especially during the pandemic, SBT is helping families receive medical care via its community program team and Childline team. Sanitisation kits and food is also being distributed among several disadvantaged communities across Delhi. SBT continues its work of rescuing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> and providing tools for their rehabilitation. You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to the education of children</a>&nbsp;and help children lead better lives. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-76" src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20-Aug-1.jpg" alt="street children" width="943" height="417"></p>
<p>Adolescence can be a period of great emotional torment, not only for the child but also for the family. Confused due to&nbsp;various bodily changes, a child often experiments with the development of their personality before a coherent identity is&nbsp;formed. How children see the world is bound to be framed, primarily and directly, by what they experience at home.&nbsp;Sensitive care-giving can thus help form a safe internal and external world.</p>
<p>In its absence,&nbsp;however, a child can find his or herself grappling with fragile emotional health, more so when the child has to witness parental divorce.</p>
<p>Radhika*&nbsp;arrived at Salaam Baalak Trust<strong><b>&nbsp;</b></strong>in a similar state of vulnerability. Forced to take responsibility of her siblings at 13, she found herself clueless about her father&#8217;s sudden abandonment. Vacant eyes, dishevelled appearance and muted responses to the counsellor were enough to indicate that something was amiss. For the first three weeks,&nbsp;her interaction was limited to another girl&nbsp;who was&nbsp;two years’ her senior. She would pick leaves from&nbsp;plants, chew the skin on her fingers and avoid conversations. In the NFE&nbsp;(Non-Formal Education)&nbsp;classes,&nbsp;she would often be found lost and oblivious to the teacher. Indifferent to the contents on TV,&nbsp;Radhika&nbsp;would often be found blankly staring at the screen; even the study table where she sat had violent graving&nbsp;from geometry instruments.</p>
<p>In the second month,&nbsp;the breakthrough happened&nbsp;when Radhika&nbsp;was given the task to distribute lunch. This was the first time she responded to the social worker without resistance. The act of giving nutrition had created a thaw in her otherwise impervious demeanour. She was praised and encouraged by the coordinator of the shelter home. With time,&nbsp;she began to revel in the various duties of the centre, often taking initiative to clean the environment. Gradually she was&nbsp;found combing hair of girls who were junior to her and watering plants she had earlier picked leaves from. These activities went in tandem with the clinical work of the counsellor,&nbsp;in consultation with the psychiatrist. With attention to small but significant milestones, she finally began to confide in the counsellor. From monosyllabic utterance to casual gossip and complains,&nbsp;the clouds of diagnosed depression were lifting. The medicines helped enable&nbsp;the psychotherapeutic process to take deeper effect.</p>
<p>Four months in, Radhika started to actively participate in quizzes, group sessions and classes. Her nurturing personality won her many friends who would seek her&nbsp;out&nbsp;all day long.&nbsp;&#8220;Radhika Didi&#8221; finally and firmly established herself as an indispensable part of the community, leading by example and healing those in need.</p>
<p>The sessions revealed that her mother&nbsp;lived in a hostel in the city with other two children and worked as a housemaid.&nbsp;Radhika was&nbsp;admitted by her&nbsp;mother&nbsp;in the hope for a better life and with full belief in Radhika&#8217;s resilience. During family counselling sessions,&nbsp;the collective trauma of the family was unpacked and sensitively processed. Growing from strength to strength,&nbsp;Radhika gained admission in&nbsp;a regular school and went on to score 75 percent in her 12th grade. She&nbsp;also&nbsp;went on to pursue her graduation through the Vahani scholarship at IP University and won a Gandhi Fellowship where she would get paid to teach underprivileged kids. Parallelly,&nbsp;Radhika has gained admission in the prestigious TISS (Tata Institute of Social Sciences) to pursue a Master&#8217;s program in Social Work,&nbsp;with a focus on Dalit and Tribal Studies.</p>
<p>Radhika now&nbsp;has to choose between the prospect of teaching or&nbsp;studying a Master&#8217;s program. Thus,&nbsp;from a child whose life hit rock bottom,&nbsp;Radhika is now spoilt for choice between two meaningful career prospects.</p>
<p>The choice,&nbsp;as always,&nbsp;remains hers. As for the kids at the centre, &#8220;Radhika Didi&#8221; would continue to inspire the community of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/"><span style="color: #333333;">street children</span></a>&nbsp;for years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>*name changed to protect the child’s identity</p>

<p>A child’s heart is as pristine as the untouched glaciers of Himalayas. This world <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="6" data-gr-id="6">however</g>, gets more and more toxic with each passing day. Coming from a house where violence was an everyday reality, this particular child’s heart was soon contaminated with violence and the fear of being a subject to it. </p>



<p>Living with&nbsp;an alcoholic father is much too common a reality in India. Most rural households struggle with this reality and the focus remains on the women who suffer because of these men. Our story, however,&nbsp;is about a little boy who saw his mother get beaten up and then himself became a victim. He would run away from his home, only to come back a couple of days later. Multiple occasions of having been beaten and watching his mother succumb to the same ire,&nbsp;this child developed a reaction to even the thought of aggression – his hands and feet would begin shaking uncontrollably. This was his state when one night his father asked him to go away and never come back. </p>



<p>It wasn’t an ultimatum that he was opposed to. He had been through too much already and he left that day to never return. Leaving was easy, but to know where he was to go instead was not. He travelled across the country, begging for food and shelter. Though he slept on an empty stomach from time to time, this life was better than the one he had left behind. His otherwise simple life as a vagabond came to a screeching halt when one evening while sitting on the banks of a river he saw a multitude of dead bodies floating in the river. The horror brought back everything he had left behind and fear gripped him; and with that fear, the shaking returned. &nbsp;</p>



<p>He arrived at DRMC in the year 2010, only to run away from here too. Eventually he returned in 2013. Those two years took a bigger toll on him than one would expect. He managed to cultivate a debilitating addiction to certain local drugs, which only made his recovery much harder than it already was. He couldn’t sleep in the night, consequently couldn’t wake up in the mornings. While he was low on energy throughout the day, thoughts of violence came to him regularly and left him shaking. Amidst this hopelessness,&nbsp;he started having suicidal thoughts. His dreams were infested with pain too – he had nightmares where his whole face was bleeding. He also developed a passionate dislike toward his own self – his looks, his height etc. Unfortunately, this&nbsp;wasn’t the end of it. Any violent situation, even if it didn’t concern him, continued to impact him the same way – he would uncontrollably shiver. This kind of ‘domino effect’ affects the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health of many street children</a>&nbsp;in their own way.</p>



<p>The path that he was on needed immediate intervention and so he was sent in for a clinical assessment. There he was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The next step was a triangulated approach toward his healing, with the clinicians prescribing medication, the counsellor s&nbsp;working through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to deal with the self-destructive thoughts, and also educating him about sleep hygiene, relaxation and mindfulness. For his part, this child was an avid reader and helped himself by reading the book ‘Dealing with Depression’. &nbsp;Eventually, he started playing squash and also developed an interest in performative arts, and began anchoring at&nbsp;various SBT events. </p>



<p>Coming from hurt and pain, a little child, who was one among 4 siblings had somehow started grasping at straws to make changes and live a better life. Today,&nbsp;this 17 year old is pursuing senior secondary education and is a state &amp; national-level squash player. His recovery stands as a testament to his determination and will power&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;you can help by <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for street children </a>like him.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65" src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Condition-of-Street-Children-1.jpg" alt="abandoned child rescue" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>There are millions of street children in India &#8211; unfortunately, the number has only spiked in the last decade. There are many reasons why children become runaways, hawkers, thieves, work odd jobs, or do absolutely nothing in life &#8211; nothing productive anyway.</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> spend their lives on the streets of big market areas amid all of the hustle-bustle, or throw away their nights and days on railway stations. A lot many homeless children can also be found loitering or begging on the steps of places of worship (mosques, temples, Gurudwaras etc) or making themselves invisible in busy areas of bus depots or abandoned areas under bridges, behind massive parking lots etc. The life of a child living on the street is one full of dread. Unspeakable living conditions, minimal nutrition, and barely able to keep themselves safe (mentally, physical or emotionally) is what a young child goes through on a daily basis. To understand the situation better, it is integral to know the types that are included under the term ‘street child’.</p>
<p>There are mainly three broad categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Children that live with their families on the street &#8211; These children are more commonly under the category of ‘working children’ as well, often as added help to their families to meet the minimum needs of the family.</li>
<li>Children that have remote interaction with their families &#8211; They usually live on their own (could also be part of other groups of street children). Their economic survival is usually negligible.</li>
<li>Children that have absolutely no connection with their families &#8211; These children are usually runaways or orphans, and are more vulnerable to abuse and extremely inhuman living conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several reasons as to why street children live in such life-threatening conditions &#8211; one of the main being poverty, abuse, lack of adult guidance, lack of education etc, thus making the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/projects.php">rescue of abandoned children</a> even more integral and urgent.</p>
<p>Salaam Baalak Trust came into existence to help street and working children restore their lives and lead respectable, safe and happy lives ahead. The non profit organisation has been dedicated towards helping disadvantaged children lead purposeful lives, where they are included into the society with open arms, devoid of judgement or malice.</p>
<p>SBT has been running several programs that include the rescue of street children, and successfully reuniting them with their families in many cases. If you don’t want to turn a blind eye any further, and want to ensure that no more children roam aimlessly and anxiously on the streets of our country, reach out to Salaam Baalak Trust at <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/</a> and join their efforts.</p>
