<p>Regular education is a
fundamental right that every child deserves, including those who find
themselves living on the streets. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street
children in India</a> face unique challenges that make access to education even
more critical. At-risk children often lack stable homes, face poverty, and may
have experienced trauma or abuse. Providing them with a consistent and quality
education is essential for breaking the cycle of poverty and offering them a
chance at a brighter future.</p>



<p>Education serves as a beacon of
hope, offering street children a sense of purpose and stability. It provides
them with a structured environment that fosters personal development, social
skills, and a sense of belonging. Through education, they learn not only
academic subjects but also important life skills, such as communication,
problem-solving, and critical thinking. These skills are invaluable in helping
them navigate the complexities of the world.</p>



<p>Integral resources and support
are crucial for the education of underprivileged children. Access to proper
nutrition, healthcare, and counselling services can address their immediate
needs and create an environment conducive to learning. Adequate clothing and a
safe place to study are equally important, as they promote a sense of dignity
and self-worth. Additionally, trained educators and mentors play a pivotal role
in providing the emotional and academic support these children require to thrive.</p>



<p>Regular education also offers
street and working children a sense of normalcy and routine, which can be
transformative. It introduces them to positive role models and peers, providing
opportunities for healthy social interaction and friendship. Furthermore,
education opens doors to future employment opportunities, breaking the cycle of
poverty and homelessness.</p>



<p>In conclusion, regular education
is not only a right but also a powerful tool for empowering street children. It
equips them with the skills, knowledge, and confidence they need to overcome
adversity and build a brighter future. By providing integral resources and
unwavering support, society can help underserved children reclaim their
potential and contribute meaningfully to their communities.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a charitable
organisation, makes a profound impact on the lives of street children. They
emphasise the importance of education, offering these underprivileged kids a
glimmer of hope. Through <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donations for a child&#8217;s
education</a>, the trust mobilises resources to provide marginalised children
with access to quality schooling, essential resources, and emotional support.
This contribution enables them to break free from the cycle of destitution,
offering a brighter, more promising future. Donate now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-1024x682.jpeg" alt="Healthcare for Street Children" class="wp-image-395" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Essential-Healthcare-to-Street-Children.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the heart of bustling cities, there exists an expansive group that is often overlooked and forgotten: street children. These young souls, braving the harsh realities of life on the streets, face an uphill battle against not only poverty and neglect but also a lack of access to proper healthcare. The need to protect underprivileged children and provide them with comprehensive healthcare support is paramount, as it directly impacts their chances of having a healthy, happy childhood and a promising future.</p>



<p>Imagine a childhood spent without the warmth of a secure home, without proper nourishment, and without the protection of basic medical care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a> are exposed to numerous health risks, from malnutrition and respiratory infections to injuries sustained on the unforgiving streets. The absence of timely medical attention exacerbates their vulnerability, jeopardising their overall well-being. By extending proper healthcare to these children, we ensure not only their physical health but also their mental and emotional resilience.</p>



<p>A healthy childhood
is the foundation upon which a promising future is built. Adequate healthcare
plays an indispensable role in nurturing the potential of at-risk children,
enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and adversity. When these children
receive regular medical check-ups, vaccinations, and treatments, they are
better equipped to focus on their education and personal growth. By addressing
their health needs, we pave the way for a brighter tomorrow where these
children can contribute positively to society.</p>



<p>Moreover, providing
healthcare support to underserved children sends a powerful message—that they
matter. When we invest in their well-being, we communicate their worth and
dignity as individuals. This fosters a sense of belonging and instills in them
the confidence to dream big. A healthy childhood brings with it a sense of
normalcy, offering these children a chance to experience the joys and wonders that
every child deserves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a beacon of hope, is dedicated to uplifting street and working children. With unwavering commitment, they provide essential medical aid, nurturing these young lives towards brighter futures. By offering healthcare and resources, SBT ensures that vulnerable children receive the care they deserve. Your support can change lives, offering these children a chance for better health and opportunities. Let&#8217;s come together to create lasting change. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for Street children</a> and become a part of SBT&#8217;s inspiring journey.</p>

<p>In recent years, the number of people in India who suffer from depression, anxiety, and other related mental illnesses has increased significantly. In the case of children living on the streets of India, the condition has only worsened, with dangerous surroundings, deteriorating habits, and little or no resources to bank upon. Children who live on the streets have fewer chances for emotional and physical well-being. They are denied the two fundamental emotions for any child—care and love.</p>



<p>Food, shelter, education, basic medical resources etc. are every child’s basic rights, but they still do not have access to these, let alone guidance to improve their mental health. Besides tangible aids, underprivileged children require collective efforts and essential tools, along with healthcare professionals, to work on their mental health. At such an impressionable age, underprivileged children live in such difficult environments. It is time to pay attention to their overall welfare to help them build their personalities and strive for a positive and productive future.</p>



<p>Only a small number of NGOs are genuinely striving to rescue street children and work with them towards rehabilitation in all ways possible. The majority of these cases involve violence, sexual assault, child labour, trafficking etc. This is why it is important to rescue these children and provide them with a secure home complete with all the necessary comforts.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi-NCR</a>, has been working to support street children for over 30 years. The NGO is strategically placed in New Delhi and works around the clock to protect children by rescuing and rehabilitating them and offering them Children’s Homes where they are placed to eventually attend school and receive the finest care that all children deserve.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for children</a>&nbsp;to help them live better lives than the ones on the streets. You can also avail of an&nbsp;income tax exemption&nbsp;under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act to help create a promising future for India’s children. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s mental health programmes now!</p>

<p>In India, several children live on the streets. These children are not raised by anyone, rather they take care of themselves in every way possible. This is why disadvantaged children frequently work odd jobs or partake in illicit activities to support themselves. They struggle to find the minimal necessities, such as food, clothing, meals, and shelter, to survive the difficulties that engulf them. Their surroundings are unpredictable and dark. The underbelly of Delhi, in particular, is no place for young children and yet there are millions of underprivileged children who try every day to somehow survive those overwhelming streets. </p>



<p><a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a>&nbsp;engage in employment throughout those formative years as daily wagers to obtain basic resources. Although it has an impact on their mental, physical, and even emotional health, children persevere and work hard to earn minimum wages to survive on their own on the unforgiving streets.</p>



<p>A major amount of labour force constitutes children. For factory owners, this is the most cost-effective option because children are an illegal workforce and will labour for lesser money and a lot of hard work. Sadly, they are expected to work long hours in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in factories. Children can be found working in varied places, including local restaurants, vendor shops, and companies that produce crackers, clothes, coal, etc. Car cleaners, warehouse employees, porters at train stations and bus stops, messenger boys, and other odd jobs are just a few examples where children can be seen working. Another self-employed activity that frequently involves street children is rag picking. Children gather these arbitrary goods, such as plastic bottles, paper, and tin, which they can sell to make some basic money for food or any other essential resource. Children gather materials to sell for recycling from dustbins and other dumping areas nearby, also known as ragpickers. And yet, no one speaks up for them or protects them.</p>



<p>Street and working children are in desperate need of assistance. A reputable non-profit organisation in India, Salaam Baalak Trust, works with children in need to uplift and empower them through education, healthcare facilities, a safe shelter, performing arts programmes, mental health support etc. Your contribution can significantly improve the lives of children living on the streets.&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a>&nbsp;right away and help Salaam Baalak Trust make a real difference!</p>

<p><br>India has a large population of street children. Using India&#8217;s massive rail system, children run away from their homes to escape abuse, violence, and poverty. They travel to big cities in the hopes of leaving that overwhelmingly difficult life behind, only to find themselves in the underbelly of the streets, alone and deprived. When thousands of children arrive at India&#8217;s enormous and crowded train stations, they are disoriented, afraid, and alone, with no idea what to do. They are forced to live on the platforms after having their ambitions ruthlessly crushed. This is happening with innumerable children on a daily basis.</p>



<p>For several troublesome reasons, children flee their homes or are compelled to do so. Many people desire a better future and the chance to work in urban areas. But without any resources at all, they are neither able to survive on the streets nor reunite with their families.</p>



<p>Abusers looking to take advantage of vulnerable and lonely children roam around in the hopes of finding these children to make them their prey for vested interests. They either exploit them by engaging the children in child labour or other forms of child trafficking, or other illegal activities like robbery, prostitution etc. This also compels many children to turn to substance misuse to handle their mental health and many other difficulties but addiction only makes matters worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s well-known&nbsp;<a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a>, has been working hard to help rescue and rehabilitate underprivileged children. SBT has been running multiple shelter homes to ensure children have access to food, shelter, safety, and assistance. SBT has been working hard for their welfare for over 30 years. It is time to protect more children and prevent them from being ignored or abused, and that is why SBT runs varied child-centric programmes besides its education programmes for children. The activities include mental health support, performing arts workshops, sports practices etc. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a>&nbsp;to help make a difference and gift a better and more promising future to these forgotten children.</p>

<p><a href="https://salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children in India</a>&nbsp;have been struggling for most of their childhood to make ends meet. It is an excruciating task to survive on the harsh streets, also known as the underbelly that is not talked about. Many day-to-day atrocities take place that severely affects children in particular. After all, their impressionable minds and developing bodies are mostly unable to bear the pressures of all the changes and dangers that they face daily.</p>



<p>Safety in many unforeseeable situations and protection from varied dangerous characters is a constant struggle. Even then, children are forced to look after themselves – without having any access to their basic rights of regular education, proper meals, healthcare facilities etc. Many street children work during these impressionable years – they can be found working long and tedious hours at the local <em>dhabas</em>, as domestic help, young girls and boys begging at traffic signals, or becoming a helper to the vegetable seller. Other children can be found rag-picking, and some end up engaging in violence, theft, and even human trafficking – either by force or due to the unfortunate turn of fate.</p>



<p>Children in need must be able to go to school and participate in varied artistic and physical activities to hone their personalities. They must be given the opportunity to shine and flourish through their skills and preferences in life. But the lack of adult supervision and little or no access to resources charts a different life trajectory – one that suppresses them and deteriorates their life. Many children also end up facing mental health issues as most children on the streets face mental, physical, and psychological trauma – that carries out for many years ahead.</p>



<p>It is time we give a real chance to millions of children on the streets to ensure they have a more fulfilling, wholesome, positive, and prosperous future. An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation in India</a>&nbsp;to a trusted and respected non-profit organization like Salaam Baalak Trust can make quite a difference to these children. So wait no more and donate to gift a promising future to street children &#8211; one that they truly deserve. You can also spread the word in your community and circle of friends and family about SBT’s programs. Come together and support these children who have been forgotten by society. Donate to Salaam Baalak Trust now!</p>

<p>India is a wonderful country with many developments and milestones that have been acknowledged on the world stage. People in India are generous too, helping those in need. Donations are integral for the non-profit organisations that have been working to protect underprivileged communities. Many people, especially <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children in India</a>, are still living without any of the basic resources. Children on the streets struggle to find food, shelter, education, safety, or protection. They constantly live in a vulnerable environment, deprived of support or improvement in any area of their lives.</p>



<p>Donating for the welfare of children can bring
quite a change in their lives. Children can get the opportunity to live without
fear or insecurities. They can also have a productive and positive childhood
that most street children never get to experience. Many working children engage
in child labour where they work odd jobs to earn a basic wage to survive
somehow. Many children fall into the trap of drug abuse, prostitution, violence
etc that does a lot of harm to them – mentally, physically, and psychologically
too.</p>



<p>Generous contributions to an NGO can help run child-centric programs to rescue and rehabilitate children and give them a life where they grow up to be in white-collar jobs – without the fear of poverty or illiteracy. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working towards the welfare of children for over 30 years. The NGO is known for its varied programs that help build better lives for street children. Donors can support Salaam Baalak Trust and even save tax on their donations. A monthly or one-time donation can help underprivileged children in more ways than one. SBT runs varied boys and girls residential homes across Delhi/NCR. A birthday donation or any other special occasion donation can also help in providing necessities to children under SBT’s care. It is time to help make a difference and ensure children have a real chance at a promising future. Avail a 50% income tax exemption under 80G of the Income Tax Act and ensure a safe and healthy life for street and working children. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for children’s education</a> and support Salaam Baalak Trust now! </p>

<p>Diwali is here &#8211; the wonderful festival of lights that brings prosperity and joy into our lives. But this is not the case for street children. Millions of children go to work every day to earn daily wages. This is their reality of street children and the reason behind their deteriorating health &#8211; mental, physical and emotional. Countless children from all walks of life in India spend their childhood working hard to earn any basic wages to have access to some resources to survive. Instead of enjoying the joys of these early growth periods, they work long hours and are involved in tedious chores. Child labour has become the norm for most people where they don&#8217;t bat an eye when children beg on the streets or work at a roadside stall or as domestic help etc. Children can even be seen washing dishes behind the restaurant, sitting at paan shops, or shining shoes on many busy streets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason for their participation in multiple areas of work is because they have no other option to survive. Most underprivileged children are orphans and live in abject poverty. Many are also abandoned while others work to help contribute to their family’s minimum income. Many children run away from home; these street children do not have any guardians or other resources to guide them on the right path to a healthy childhood.</p>



<p>There are many dangerous places such as different types of factories etc where children can be found working in extreme heat or bitter cold. They participate in dangerous activities to earn less than the minimum wage, even at the expense of their health. Children can be seen working at factories that produce clothing, crackers, tobacco, biscuits, etc, and many other unstructured businesses that employ young children to work for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Child labour keeps children away from playing with other children which is extremely harmful to a child during their impressionable years. This greatly affects their psychological and social development. Through proper playtime activities, children learn to cultivate friendship and nurture positive connections with others which helps them become confident, compassionate and caring people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the true essence of Diwali, an auspicious occasion, you can donate to Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has been working for the welfare of street children for over 30 years. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">Donate for children&#8217;s medical aid</a> and help SBT <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescue abandoned children</a>.

<p>Street children found on the streets is a norm in India. Millions of children live on the streets, without any basic resources. This has become a sight that everyone has gotten used to which, unfortunately, does not make one cringe. But this could not be worse for society and India’s development, besides the negative impact it has on the lives of those children. After all, the condition of the youth defines where the country is heading. Children without any guardians or support system to guide them through childhood, puberty and eventually adulthood are horrifying; these impressionable years much be acknowledged and worked upon with the respective child.</p>



<p>In the case of street children, most of them are runaways who
were desperate to escape the situation at home – it could be due to poverty,
abuse, exploitation, lack of love and care etc. The situation on the streets is
no better of course but it is too late for the child to realise as they are
already living on the streets by then. They have no money for basic utilities,
no shelter for protection, and no access to meals or a group of people to
depend on.</p>



<p>The reason why street children are considered as one of the most
vulnerable groups in India (UNICEF) is that they are susceptible to all sorts
of abuse &#8211; child labour, sexual abuse (prostitution, child trafficking etc),
child marriage, illiteracy etc.</p>



<p>The health of underprivileged children also gets quite compromised as they do not have access to regular vaccinations, integral immunizations etc. They are also deprived of quality healthcare, especially mental health programs which are much needed as many street children fall into the traps of hard drugs, depression and other forms of self-harm. Many of them are unable to communicate with other people or exhibit social skills of any sort. Lack of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health programs for street children</a><strong> </strong>can prove to be more harmful, affect their personal growth and decrease their chances of having a safe and supportive community.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate to children’s education</a>​ and support Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organisation in India that has empowered thousands of street children. Donate now!</p>
