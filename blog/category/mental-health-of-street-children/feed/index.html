<p>Street children in India face a multitude of challenges, including poor living conditions, limited access to education, and inadequate healthcare. Providing quality medical care for these vulnerable children is not just a basic human right; it is also crucial for their overall well-being and future prospects.</p>



<p>Many of the at-risk children lack access to basic medical
aid such as vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care.
This is due to a variety of factors, including poverty, social exclusion, and
discrimination. Without access to proper medical support, street children are
more likely to suffer from serious illnesses and injuries, and their physical
and mental development can be affected.</p>



<p>In addition to physical healthcare, it is also important
to address the mental health of street children. These children often face
traumatic experiences such as abuse, neglect, and violence. The stress and
anxiety associated with living on the streets can also take a toll on their
mental health. However, mental health issues are often overlooked, with little
attention paid to the psychological needs of street children. This can have
serious long-term consequences, including a higher risk of developing mental
health disorders and difficulties in social and emotional development.</p>



<p>To address these issues, it is crucial to provide quality
medical support that is accessible and culturally sensitive. Healthcare
providers should be trained to understand the unique needs of street children
and provide care that is tailored to their specific circumstances. This
includes addressing the mental health needs of street children and providing
appropriate counselling and support.</p>



<p>One way to improve access to <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach-and-community-projects.php">medical aid for street children</a> is through mobile clinics. These clinics can travel to areas where street children congregate, such as railway stations, bus stops, and parks. They can provide basic healthcare services, including vaccinations, treatment for common illnesses, and emergency care. Mobile clinics can also provide mental health support and counselling, which is crucial for addressing the mental health needs of street children.</p>



<p>Another way to address the healthcare needs of street
children is through partnerships between healthcare providers and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that work with street children. These
partnerships can provide a more comprehensive approach to healthcare,
addressing both physical and mental health needs. NGOs can also provide a safe
space for street children to access healthcare without fear of discrimination
or stigma.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust is one such <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">charitable trust in Delhi</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/"> </a></strong>that provides varied resources of paramount importance to the welfare of street and working children in India. SBT ensures it provides a safe and protective environment for these children, who face painful and horrific experiences on the streets that are often unspeakable. Your <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">online donation in India</a> can help SBT provide healthcare aid that is accessible, culturally sensitive, and addresses their unique needs. Support now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Mental Health Support To Street Children" class="wp-image-355" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_1058-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In recent years, the number of people in India who suffer from depression, anxiety, and other related mental illnesses has increased significantly. In the case of children living on the streets of India, the condition has only worsened, with dangerous surroundings, deteriorating habits, and little or no resources to bank upon. Children who live on the streets have fewer chances for emotional and physical well-being. They are denied the two fundamental emotions for any child—care and love.</p>



<p>Food, shelter, education, basic medical resources etc. are every child’s basic rights, but they still do not have access to these, let alone guidance to improve their mental health. Besides tangible aids, underprivileged children require collective efforts and essential tools, along with healthcare professionals, to work on their mental health. At such an impressionable age, underprivileged children live in such difficult environments. It is time to pay attention to their overall welfare to help them build their personalities and strive for a positive and productive future.</p>



<p>Only a small number of NGOs are genuinely striving to rescue street children and work with them towards rehabilitation in all ways possible. The majority of these cases involve violence, sexual assault, child labour, trafficking etc. This is why it is important to rescue these children and provide them with a secure home complete with all the necessary comforts.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">NGO in Delhi-NCR</a>, has been working to support street children for over 30 years. The NGO is strategically placed in New Delhi and works around the clock to protect children by rescuing and rehabilitating them and offering them Children’s Homes where they are placed to eventually attend school and receive the finest care that all children deserve.</p>

You can also avail of an&nbsp;income tax exemption&nbsp;under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act to help create a promising future for India’s children.

<p>Without the presence of responsible and loving parents or other guardians, children living and working on the streets go through each day as it comes. Additionally, they lack fundamental rights to education and healthcare as well as necessities like healthcare, food, and shelter.</p>



<p>It is regrettably not surprising to see street children&#8217;s mental health deteriorate in such a trying setting where they are constantly exposed to many vulnerabilities. Street children experience several difficulties with their mental development, ranging from dysfunctional emotional patterns to stunted personality development.</p>



<p>Following are some of the key reasons why street and working children still suffer with their mental health:</p>



<p>Lack of Assistance<br>One of the biggest causes of mental health problems in children is a lack of affection and care. The children come from a large number of impoverished families. Many of these families regularly engage in acts of mental, physical, or emotional violence. Children who grow up in such a stressful environment often feel alone and defeated.</p>



<p>Leading a Lifestyle of Abuse<br>Children who live on the streets have either witnessed abuse at home and decided to leave, or they have come across abuse after moving in with strangers; occasionally, they have gone through both scenarios. The youngsters feel much more self-destructive since they live in a society that stigmatises abuse.</p>



<p>Abuse of Drugs<br>Many children use drugs and other vices to control their emotional desires. They inadvertently stop growing mentally and emotionally in order to avoid experiencing severe pain and go on to lead unhealthy and destructive lives with a false sense of consciousness.</p>



<p>The subject of mental health needs to be discussed even more thoroughly in a society where it is still a taboo. A non-profit organisation called Salaam Baalak Trust has been working relentlessly to provide support for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/mental-health.php">mental health to street children</a>. In order to address the challenges related to the mental health and well-being of street and working children, SBT launched a well-structured Mental Health Programme (MHP) in February 2003. It started with a core group of four members, headed by Dr. Amit Sen, (MD &#8211; Psychiatry, MRCPsych, London; Specialist, Training in Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, UK). Over time, the team extended further and at present comprises an able and qualified group of 8 counseling psychologists and two special educators. The Mental Health Programme of SBT has the vision to promote and enhance positive mental health in children/adolescents. Its main objective is the early identification and management of mental health issues in children and adolescents.</p>



<p>It is time we join hands to make a generous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donation</a>&nbsp;to help support working and street children through a variety of child-centric activities. Support SBT’s programmes now and help make a difference in the lives of children in need!</p>
