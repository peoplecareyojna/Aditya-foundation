<p>Street children are a reality and their existence must be acknowledged as a first step. There are millions of children living on the streets of India, without any adult supervision or support from society. These children are deprived of any of the basic rights – they do not have access to proper education, daily meals, healthcare facilities, or a safe shelter. The children are either runaways, orphans, have cut ties with their family, or are unable to locate them and have no other option but to live on the streets.</p>



<p>All of these children live on their own – they work odd jobs to gather some basic earnings to live off on the streets. Be it in factories or at restaurants, children are employed for odd jobs where their wages are bare minimum and their rights are compromised. Child labour is a major issue in India as children work in unhealthy and unsafe environments. At the age when they should be studying in schools and playing with other children of their age, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a> put their lives in danger on a daily basis to earn money. Their mental, physical, and psychological well-being is attacked and deteriorates due to such circumstances.</p>



<p>Children’s mental health also gets affected as children need to be in a healthy environment. They deserve a safe and protected atmosphere to grow properly and healthily. Regular medical tests are also important that must include timely vaccinations. Immunizations can help protect children from avoidable diseases as avoiding these can even affect them for life, or worse, cause death.</p>



<p>Underprivileged children deserve to be around positive, encouraging, and supportive adults. They must be given playtime and tools to grow up to be independent and wholesome individuals. Many non-profit organizations are working to improve the lives of children. Salaam Baalak Trust is a renowned NGO that has been working for over 30 years to rescue and rehabilitate children. SBT is ensuring that children receive food, security, health, education and love – essentials required for children to grow up well. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate for street children</a> and help make a real difference in their lives. Support Salaam Baalak Trust now!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-1024x683.jpg" alt="Protecting Street Children In India" class="wp-image-238" srcset="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Street children can be found all over India &#8211; at bus stops, railways stations, dark alleys, poverty-stricken colonies, highways etc. Their existence is often ignored by the privileged ones but that needs to stop. After all, a country’s progress is defined by how the youth is progressing, and the reality of street children is deplorable. Millions of children live without adult supervision or any sort of essential resources. They do not have access to monetary or mental support to help navigate life and grow in a healthy environment.</p>



<p>15th August is here! A special day for Indians across the globe as Independence Day is celebrated with much pride and pomp. This day cannot be commemorated without acknowledging the issue and vowing to be more rigorous in protecting underprivileged children. Their plight needs to heard and resolved in more ways than one. From everyday violence to life-threatening scenarios, from zero accountability to illegal activities, from acute poverty to lack of any scope of a healthy and happy future, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>, like all other children, deserve a better life.</p>



<p>Some basic resources help lead a quality life for everyone,
including underprivileged children who do not have these aids. These include
quality education, regular and nutritious meals, proper healthcare facilities,
and a safe shelter. Children also require love, care, protection, and mental
health support to grow in nurturing and positive surroundings.</p>



<p>A conducive environment for children must include these integral
resources and Salaam Baalak Trust, a well-known non-profit organization in
India, ensures it. SBT rescues and reunites children with their respective
families, or places them at SBT’s Children’s Homes. SBT also ensures that
children are well looked after and have an opportunity to engage in
extra-curricular activities like sports, performing arts etc.</p>



<p>This Independence Day, you can grab the opportunity to celebrate
the true spirit of the occasion by helping SBT protect children. They deserve
to attend school and have a good job in the future. So, <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for&nbsp;children’s
medical aid</a>&nbsp;and help Salaam Baalak Trust run its programs for the
welfare of children. Support now!</p>

<p>All children deserve a life that includes basic resources, protection, encouragement, and opportunities to grow. Their birth-right includes utilities as well as a wholesome environment that helps them prosper and constantly strive for excellence.</p>



<p>A conducive environment for children also includes one where
they are surrounded by mentors and other encouraging adults who guide them and
support them through all hurdles and milestones. Regular schooling, hot and
nutritious meals that they have access to at least thrice a day, a safe
shelter, and quality healthcare facilities are some of the resources that play
a pivotal role in all children’s lives. These are all necessities that help
them in many ways to lead a happy childhood and strive for a better future.</p>



<p>But in the case of <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>, the reality is quite different. There is a dearth of material and emotional support, and what makes matters worse is that they need to fend for themselves in an unforgiving and tough world on the streets.</p>



<p>Deprived of mental health and tools to handle difficult
situations does not help their cause either. From facing everyday challenges
alone to falling into the traps of substance abuse, many factors play a part in
the deteriorating conditions of underprivileged children. Some children also
end up participating in child labour where they work long hours as daily wage
earners for minimum pay. This affects them mentally, physically, and
emotionally, and also depletes their chances of landing a stable and
well-paying job in the future.</p>



<p>One of the most reputed non-profit organisations is Salaam Baalak Trust that has been working to rescue and rehabilitate street and working children. You can donate for <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">children’s medical ai</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/outreach.php">d</a></strong> and help SBT ensure that abandoned children have a better childhood and a promising future.</p>



<p>The NGO runs shelter homes and many child-centric programs to
help provide essential resources for children. SBT also provides love and care,
besides running mental health programs to help with de-addiction and other
trauma that children are afflicted with from their time on the streets. So wait
no more and donate to Salaam Baalak Trust today!</p>

<p>The first wave of COVID-19 was extremely tough for the world, including India. People across the country were battling with the many repercussions of the pandemic – be it the effects of the lockdown, loss of jobs, lack of integral resources etc.</p>



<p>The situation seemed to get a tad better but it only worsened as the second wave hit India. The grave situation has brought about a lot of struggle, especially for the COVID-affected patients and their families. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">Street children</a> are one of the worst-hit communities in India during these troubled times. Millions of children live on the streets where they fend for themselves and works towards finding basic meals, a safe shelter, medical resources, regular education etc. In these difficult times, such resources are even harder to access.</p>



<p>Besides these utilities, underprivileged children and their
families are not finding healthcare facilities or other everyday essentials
that are much-needed during these tough months.</p>



<p>Below are some of the requirements that can help improve the
situation a bit for underprivileged communities:</p>



<p>Awareness sessions are much required as sensitisation can help
bust the many myths surrounding COVID-19, its effects, and the aftermath. Such
sessions will also help the community members understand how to protect
themselves and take necessary safety precautions. The drives will help guide
people who are unaware of the essential steps to take once someone in their family
is infected – they must know how to manage the illness at home and ensure it is
not spread further.</p>



<p>Providing ration and medical kits to families is a must! From
medicines to an oxygen supply, from hospital beds to mid-day meals, children
are in urgent need of such resources that must be accessible to them.</p>



<p>There are innumerable street and working children who are
ignored, abused, and severely affected by the second wave of the pandemic.
Salaam Baalak Trust, one of the most trusted non-profit organisations in India,
is working every day to help ensure that children are protected and lead a life
of dignity and care. <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">Donate
for children’s medical aid</a>
and other support right away!</p>

<p>Across the country, many children face daily struggles due to the harsh life on the streets. Millions of children in India are experiencing abuse, exploitation, hunger, and exclusion. The basic rights of children are also not extended to them – this includes the right to safety and protection, right to clean water, right to regular and healthy meals, right education, right to safe shelter, and the right to access to healthcare facilities.</p>



<p>The rights of children cannot be ignored and to ensure the same,
April 12th is marked as International Day for Street Children. This day is
commemorated to ensure that the condition of street children is brought to the
forefront and their plight is given a platform to address. It is high time
underprivileged children have a collective support system to help them step out
of the vicious cycle. The patterns of abuse, exploitation, illiteracy, and
poverty lead to many other long-term repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fundamental and constructive change is the need of the hour as
several children can still be seen begging at traffic signals, engaging in
labour work and other menial jobs to make ends meet somehow, or becoming a
ragpicker. Be it as domestic help or joining street gangs, children do anything
to survive as there is no mentoring or support system in place to guide them
through their impressionable years.</p>



<p>The International Day of Street Children is important as it helps raise much-needed awareness on the plight of the street and working children who have been discriminated against for far too long. This is where Salaam Baalak Trust, India’s reputed non-profit organisation, has been diligently working on for more than 30 years. SBT provides all of the integral resources for street and working children and also <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescues abandoned children</a>. SBT offers full care and protection to the children and ensures that they have access to health and nutrition, mental health, and quality education. The children are placed in various Children’s Homes and also enrolled in vocational training programs to help them build their personalities and expand their minds. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php"> </a></strong>and celebrate the true spirit of International Day for Street Children.

<p>Many children in India are victims of child labour, child trafficking, and child abuse. There are many atrocities that they face due to unsupervised living and in the company of shady characters that are looking after their vested interests. All children require responsible and helpful mentors to help guide them through troubles, life lessons, and other learning experiences. </p>



<p>The impact of abuse of any sort can leave a long-lasting imprint on the psyche of children. It can have severe and unexpected effects on the personality of the children as well. Without love and care, children feel lost and have a difficult time dealing with the many changes around them, and such horrific incidents can hamper their development in many ways.</p>



<p>Many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/">street children</a>&nbsp;end up resorting to drugs to handle the pressure of dealing with abuse while others join gangs or the company of untoward people on the streets to feel somewhat safe and protected. In reality, they are anything but safe as they often begin participating in illegal activities like selling drugs, pick-pocketing etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positive and productive environment, proper infrastructure, and generous care are basic needs for underprivileged children who have lived on the streets. They also require basic education, healthcare facilities, safe shelter, and responsible adults around them to support and encourage them. Extra-curricular activities are also essential to help nurture children and give them the platform to express themselves.</p>



<p>Salaam Baalak Trust, a reputed non-profit organization in India, works relentlessly to provide all of the aforementioned facilities at the SBT shelter homes for boys and girls. Salaam Baalak Trust has been working in the area of children’s welfare for the last several decades. They have rescued and rehabilitated several children and even reunited many of them with their families. Such efforts have improved the lives of many children and given a new lease to them where they have grown up to have successful careers. You can also support SBT’s programs and support underprivileged children by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donating for children’s education</a>&nbsp;and also availing a 50% tax deduction under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/donate-for-street-children.jpg" alt="street children in India" class="wp-image-202"/></figure>



<p>Street children are not a rare sight in India. They are all around us and unfortunately, it has become normal to see them and not pay heed to their existence on the streets. Children are the future of every country as they lead the nation forward towards newer developments and heights of success. But millions of children in India are living on the streets and looking after themselves however they best can.</p>



<p>All children require necessities like food, shelter, and clothing. There are other integral resources too that help contributes to their development like healthcare facilities, participation in extra-curricular activities etc. Having responsible and caring adults around also helps provide them with a support system that is much-required during the initial impressionable years of children. The streets are harsh and deprived of such resources that further deteriorate their living conditions. Living in such extreme vulnerable conditions, that too, at such a young age, can be traumatising and that is why many children on the streets resort to drug abuse, violence etc.</p>



<p>The
fundamental requirement in the case of street children is the understanding of
their basic rights and provide them with those like basic education. Attending
school and receiving a quality education is essential for underprivileged
children. It not only helps them move past the vicious cycle of poverty and get
stable jobs in the future but also helps them grow up to be responsible and
driven individuals who strive for success.</p>



<p>This is where Salaam Baalak Trust comes into the picture as the well-known and reputed non-profit organisation has been working for the welfare of street children. SBT, based out of Delhi in India, focuses on <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">rescuing street children</a><strong> </strong>and help them rehabilitate and readjust in society. Many children are also helped in reuniting them with their families. Several children get separated from their families and SBT helps them find their homes.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a> and help them have a real chance at a prosperous future. Support Salaam Baalak Trust’s efforts to ensure more children have access to basic education, medical support, healthy meals etc. Donate now to make a difference!</p>

<p>There millions of children living on the streets of India. This is a harsh reality that must be improved for the betterment of the youth. The tumultuous surroundings of street children are daunting and unpredictable. Children are surrounded by adversity and shortage of all resources. Be it a safe shelter, basic education, medical facilities, or mentoring, street children do not have access to any of these essential tools to lead a happy, healthy, and productive childhood. Instead, the dark underbelly of India’s streets offers negative experiences like abuse, exploitation, violence, and depravity.</p>



<p>Street children run away from their homes due to varied reasons
revolving around discouraging circumstances but they end up in even worse
situations. Many children end up participating in child labour to survive on
the streets alone. The hours are long and the wages are the bare minimum,
besides the toll it takes on their mental and physical well-being. Several
hazardous conditions can also be found in factories where children are employed
which may have immediate as well as a long-term negative effect on them. Many
underprivileged children work as domestic help too, and what makes it worse is
that it is socially acceptable in many homes.</p>



<p>In an effort to survive on the rough streets, many children end
up engaging in illegal activities which only worsen their condition. Many
children take hard drugs too and the dependency on such chemicals makes them even
more susceptible to “do whatever it takes” for the next hit. Several children
on the streets are prone to drug abuse which is rather unfortunate as it
steadily dwindles their opportunities of a brighter and healthier future.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/blog/it-is-time-to-ensure-abandoned-street-children-are-rescued-soon/">Rescuing street children </a>is integral as they are the future of India. Salaam Baalak Trust is a reputed non-profit organisation that provides a sensitive and caring environment for street and working children. The efforts of SBT help provide a platform for children to realize their full potential, offer them their right to a safe and secure space, and give access to education, health and nutrition. You can <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">donate for street children</a><strong> </strong>to help make a difference in their lives and improve their chances of a prosperous future.</p>

<p>Mental health is getting more attention in the mainstream media in recent years – a welcome change as it signals that more people are becoming aware of the causes and impact of mental health. Innumerable people suffer silently and fight on their own, without any professional help or the support of their family and/or friends.</p>



<p>The situation is even worse for street children in India, one of
the most vulnerable groups that are often given little or no attention.
Children living on the streets and working children (engaged in child labour)
live in an environment that is not conducive for their growth.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Street children (opens in a new tab)">Street children</a> live in high-stress surroundings, constantly looking for basic utilities like food, shelter, clothing, and even a support system to depend on. Many of the rescued street children are known to experience anxiety, sleeplessness, anger and trust issues, and even end up having dependency issues due to substance abuse. Many children face domestic abuse at home and run away from their homes to search for a better environment while other children face varied types of abuse (mental, physical, emotional) on the streets – all of these leave a deep and long-lasting impact on the psyche that must be addressed and resolved. Children are quite impressionable during their formative years and require gentle and protective mentors around them to guide them through these early phases.</p>



<p>To help children have a hopeful and positive future, Salaam
Baalak Trust, one of the top NGOs in India, rescues and rehabilitates children
at their centres. They are provided with immense support, care, and essential
resources (medical facilities, access to extra-curricular activities etc) to
help them build a prosperous future. Several children who get lost or are
separated from their families are also reconnected if possible, and get a
second chance to a happier childhood.</p>



<p>You
can support the efforts of Salaam Baalak Trust and help improve the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/health-and-nutrition.php">mental health
of street children</a>. Donate for children’s overall development to ensure
their well-being. Generously contribute to Salaam Baalak Trust right away!</p>

<p>15th October is marked as World Food Day across the globe. This day is celebrated to spread awareness about the importance of food and also the harmful effects of unhealthy and irregular meals. Also, one of the main objectives of World Food Day is to throw light on the reality of less or no food available to many underserved communities in the world. Underprivileged children in Indiaare one of the worst-hit groups that face acute repercussions on their mental, physical, and emotional well-being due to starvation.</p>



<p>Healthy diets must be accessible to street children but this
necessity and basic right continue to be a privilege for millions of at-risk
children in India. Where food should be easily available and affordable, many
children who live on the streets engage in the following activities to somehow
make ends meet, to be able to have at least a meal a day.</p>



<ol><li>Many street children engage
in odd jobs like working at&nbsp;<em>dhabas</em>,
shops, selling everyday utilities etc. Child labour among street children is
extremely common because most children do not have the money to fend for
themselves, thus they become daily wagers to fill their bellies.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</li><li>The yearning for food compel
many street children to engage in illegal activities like pickpocketing,
joining street gangs, or even prostitution. The needs of street children are
neglected therefore, their source of income is derived from any means possible
which affects their current as well as long-term health.</li></ol>



<p>The impressionable years of a child&#8217;s life require for them to have regular and nutritious meals. The food must be well-cooked and prepared in a hygienic environment. Food, clothes, shelter is a right that must be extended to every child, irrespective of their economic background. Salaam Baalak Trust, a nonprofit organization based in Delhi, has been working tirelessly to ensure that street children feel safe, protected, and well looked-after. You can support the <a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/full-care-residential-programme.php">day and night shelter homes for children</a> by Salaam Baalak Trust to ensure more street childrenhave access to a safe environment and healthy meals.  This World Food Day, <strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">d</a></strong><a href="https://www.salaambaalaktrust.com/donations.php">onate</a> generously to Salaam Baalak Trust and ensure that street children under their careget three hot, cooked meals daily. </p>
